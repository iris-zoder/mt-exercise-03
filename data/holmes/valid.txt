It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested , and the fashionable world dismayed , by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances .
The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation ; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion , since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts .
Only now , at the end of nearly ten years , am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain .
The crime was of interest in itself , but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel , which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life .
Even now , after this long interval , I find myself thrilling as I think of it , and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy , amazement , and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind .
Let me say to that public which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them , for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips , which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month .
It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime , and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public , and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution , though with indifferent success .
There was none , however , which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair .
As I read the evidence at the inquest , which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown , I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes .
There were points about this strange business which would , I was sure , have specially appealed to him , and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented , or more probably anticipated , by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe .
All day as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind , and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate .
At the risk of telling a twicetold tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest .
The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth , at that time Governor of one of the Australian Colonies .
Adair &apos;s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract , and she , her son Ronald , and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427 , Park Lane .
The youth moved in the best society , had , so far as was known , no enemies , and no particular vices .
He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley , of Carstairs , but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before , and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it .
For the rest the man &apos;s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle , for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional .
Yet it was upon this easygoing young aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleventwenty on the night of March 30 , 1894 .
Ronald Adair was fond of cards , playing continually , but never for such stakes as would hurt him .
He was a member of the Baldwin , the Cavendish , and the Bagatelle card clubs .
It was shown that after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club .
He had also played there in the afternoon .
The evidence of those who had played with himMr .
Murray , Sir John Hardy , and Colonel Moranshowed that the game was whist , and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards .
Adair might have lost five pounds , but not more .
His fortune was a considerable one , and such a loss could not in any way affect him .
He had played nearly every day at one club or other , but he was a cautious player , and usually rose a winner .
It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral .
So much for his recent history , as it came out at the inquest .
On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten .
His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation .
The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor , generally used as his sittingroom .
She had lit a fire there , and as it smoked she had opened the window .
No sound was heard from the room until eleventwenty , the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter .
Desiring to say goodnight , she had attempted to enter her son &apos;s room .
The door was locked on the inside , and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking .
Help was obtained and the door forced .
The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table .
His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet , but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room .
On the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold , the money arranged in little piles of varying amount .
There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite to them , from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards .
A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex .
In the first place , no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside .
There was the possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped by the window .
The drop was at least twenty feet , however , and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath .
Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed , nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road .
Apparently , therefore , it was the young man himself who had fastened the door .
But how did he come by his death ?
No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces .
Suppose a man had fired through the window , it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound .
Again , Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare , and there is a cabstand within a hundred yards of the house .
No one had heard a shot .
And yet there was the dead man , and there the revolver bullet , which had mushroomed out , as softnosed bullets will , and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death .
Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery , which were further complicated by entire absence of motive , since , as I have said , young Adair was not known to have any enemy , and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room .
All day I turned these facts over in my mind , endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all , and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the startingpoint of every investigation .
I confess that I made little progress .
In the evening I strolled across the Park , and found myself about six o &apos;clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane .
A group of loafers upon the pavements , all staring up at a particular window , directed me to the house which I had come to see .
A tall , thin man with coloured glasses , whom I strongly suspected of being a plainclothes detective , was pointing out some theory of his own , while the others crowded round to listen to what he said .
I got as near him as I could , but his observations seemed to me to be absurd , so I withdrew again in some disgust .
As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man , who had been behind me , and I knocked down several books which he was carrying .
I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of one of them , The Origin of Tree Worship , and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who , either as a trade or as a hobby , was a collector of obscure volumes .
I endeavoured to apologize for the accident , but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner .
With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel , and I saw his curved back and white sidewhiskers disappear among the throng .
My observations of No .
427 , Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested .
The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing , the whole not more than five feet high .
It was perfectly easy , therefore , for anyone to get into the garden , but the window was entirely inaccessible , since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it .
More puzzled than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington .
I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me .
To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old bookcollector , his sharp , wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair , and his precious volumes , a dozen of them at least , wedged under his right arm .
&quot; You &apos;re surprised to see me , sir , &quot; said he , in a strange , croaking voice .
I acknowledged that I was .
&quot; Well , I &apos;ve a conscience , sir , and when I chanced to see you go into this house , as I came hobbling after you , I thought to myself , I &apos;ll just step in and see that kind gentleman , and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant , and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books . &quot;
&quot; You make too much of a trifle , &quot; said I.
&quot; May I ask how you knew who I was ? &quot;
&quot; Well , sir , if it isn &apos;t too great a liberty , I am a neighbour of yours , for you &apos;ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street , and very happy to see you , I am sure .
Maybe you collect yourself , sir ; here &apos;s British Birds , and Catullus , and The Holy Wara bargain every one of them .
With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf .
It looks untidy , does it not , sir ? &quot;
I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me .
When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table .
I rose to my feet , stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement , and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life .
Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes , and when it cleared I found my collarends undone and the tingling aftertaste of brandy upon my lips .
Holmes was bending over my chair , his flask in his hand .
&quot; My dear Watson , &quot; said the wellremembered voice , &quot; I owe you a thousand apologies .
I had no idea that you would be so affected . &quot;
I gripped him by the arm .
&quot; Holmes ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; Is it really you ?
Can it indeed be that you are alive ?
Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss ? &quot;
&quot; Wait a moment , &quot; said he .
&quot; Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things ?
I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance . &quot;
&quot; I am all right , but indeed , Holmes , I can hardly believe my eyes .
Good heavens , to think that youyou of all menshould be standing in my study ! &quot;
Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin , sinewy arm beneath it .
&quot; Well , you &apos;re not a spirit , anyhow , &quot; said I.
&quot; My dear chap , I am overjoyed to see you .
Sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm . &quot;
He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner .
He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant , but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table .
Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old , but there was a deadwhite tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one .
&quot; I am glad to stretch myself , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end .
Now , my dear fellow , in the matter of these explanations we have , if I may ask for your cooperation , a hard and dangerous night &apos;s work in front of us .
Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished . &quot;
&quot; I am full of curiosity .
I should much prefer to hear now . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll come with me tonight ? &quot;
&quot; When you like and where you like . &quot;
&quot; This is indeed like the old days .
We shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go .
Well , then , about that chasm .
I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it , for the very simple reason that I never was in it . &quot;
&quot; You never were in it ? &quot;
&quot; No , Watson , I never was in it .
My note to you was absolutely genuine .
I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety .
I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes .
I exchanged some remarks with him , therefore , and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received .
I left it with my cigarettebox and my stick and I walked along the pathway , Moriarty still at my heels .
When I reached the end I stood at bay .
He drew no weapon , but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me .
He knew that his own game was up , and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me .
We tottered together upon the brink of the fall .
I have some knowledge , however , of baritsu , or the Japanese system of wrestling , which has more than once been very useful to me .
I slipped through his grip , and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands .
But for all his efforts he could not get his balance , and over he went .
With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way .
Then he struck a rock , bounded off , and splashed into the water . &quot;
I listened with amazement to this explanation , which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette .
&quot; But the tracks ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; I saw with my own eyes that two went down the path and none returned . &quot;
&quot; It came about in this way .
The instant that the Professor had disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way .
I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death .
There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader .
They were all most dangerous men .
One or other would certainly get me .
On the other hand , if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties , these men , they would lay themselves open , and sooner or later I could destroy them .
Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living .
So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall .
&quot; I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me .
In your picturesque account of the matter , which I read with great interest some months later , you assert that the wall was sheer .
This was not literally true .
A few small footholds presented themselves , and there was some indication of a ledge .
The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility , and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks .
I might , it is true , have reversed my boots , as I have done on similar occasions , but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception .
On the whole , then , it was best that I should risk the climb .
It was not a pleasant business , Watson .
The fall roared beneath me .
I am not a fanciful person , but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty &apos;s voice screaming at me out of the abyss .
A mistake would have been fatal .
More than once , as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock , I thought that I was gone .
But I struggled upwards , and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss , where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort .
There I was stretched when you , my dear Watson , and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death .
&quot; At last , when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions , you departed for the hotel and I was left alone .
I had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures , but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me .
A huge rock , falling from above , boomed past me , struck the path , and bounded over into the chasm .
For an instant I thought that it was an accident ; but a moment later , looking up , I saw a man &apos;s head against the darkening sky , and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched , within a foot of my head .
Of course , the meaning of this was obvious .
Moriarty had not been alone .
A confederateand even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate washad kept guard while the Professor had attacked me .
From a distance , unseen by me , he had been a witness of his friend &apos;s death and of my escape .
He had waited , and then , making his way round to the top of the cliff , he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed .
&quot; I did not take long to think about it , Watson .
Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff , and I knew that it was the precursor of another stone .
I scrambled down on to the path .
I don &apos;t think I could have done it in cold blood .
It was a hundred times more difficult than getting up .
But I had no time to think of the danger , for another stone sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge .
Halfway down I slipped , but by the blessing of God I landed , torn and bleeding , upon the path .
I took to my heels , did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness , and a week later I found myself in Florence with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me .
&quot; I had only one confidantmy brother Mycroft .
I owe you many apologies , my dear Watson , but it was allimportant that it should be thought I was dead , and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true .
Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you , but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret .
For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books , for I was in danger at the time , and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results .
As to Mycroft , I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed .
The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped , for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members , my own most vindictive enemies , at liberty .
I travelled for two years in Tibet , therefore , and amused myself by visiting Lhassa and spending some days with the head Llama .
You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson , but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend .
I then passed through Persia , looked in at Mecca , and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum , the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office .
Returning to France I spent some months in a research into the coaltar derivatives , which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier , in the South of France .
Having concluded this to my satisfaction , and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London , I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery , which not only appealed to me by its own merits , but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities .
I came over at once to London , called in my own person at Baker Street , threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics , and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been .
So it was , my dear Watson , that at two o &apos;clock today I found myself in my old armchair in my own old room , and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned . &quot;
Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April eveninga narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall , spare figure and the keen , eager face , which I had never thought to see again .
In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement , and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words .
&quot; Work is the best antidote to sorrow , my dear Watson , &quot; said he , &quot; and I have a piece of work for us both tonight which , if we can bring it to a successful conclusion , will in itself justify a man &apos;s life on this planet . &quot;
In vain I begged him to tell me more .
&quot; You will hear and see enough before morning , &quot; he answered .
&quot; We have three years of the past to discuss .
Let that suffice until halfpast nine , when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house . &quot;
It was indeed like old times when , at that hour , I found myself seated beside him in a hansom , my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of adventure in my heart .
Holmes was cold and stern and silent .
As the gleam of the streetlamps flashed upon his austere features I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed .
I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London , but I was well assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one , while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest .
I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street , but Holmes stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square .
I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left , and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed .
Our route was certainly a singular one .
Holmes &apos;s knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary , and on this occasion he passed rapidly , and with an assured step , through a network of mews and stables the very existence of which I had never known .
We emerged at last into a small road , lined with old , gloomy houses , which led us into Manchester Street , and so to Blandford Street .
Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage , passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard , and then opened with a key the back door of a house .
We entered together and he closed it behind us .
The place was pitchdark , but it was evident to me that it was an empty house .
Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking , and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons .
Holmes &apos;s cold , thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forwards down a long hall , until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door .
Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right , and we found ourselves in a large , square , empty room , heavily shadowed in the corners , but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond .
There was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust , so that we could only just discern each other &apos;s figures within .
My companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear .
&quot; Do you know where we are ? &quot;
he whispered .
&quot; Surely that is Baker Street , &quot; I answered , staring through the dim window .
&quot; Exactly .
We are in Camden House , which stands opposite to our own old quarters . &quot;
&quot; But why are we here ? &quot;
&quot; Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile .
Might I trouble you , my dear Watson , to draw a little nearer to the window , taking every precaution not to show yourself , and then to look up at our old roomsthe startingpoint of so many of our little adventures ?
We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you . &quot;
I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window .
As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement .
The blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room .
The shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard , black outline upon the luminous screen of the window .
There was no mistaking the poise of the head , the squareness of the shoulders , the sharpness of the features .
The face was turned halfround , and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame .
It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes .
So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me .
He was quivering with silent laughter .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; Good heavens ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; It is marvellous . &quot;
&quot; I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety , &apos; &quot; said he , and I recognised in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation .
&quot; It really is rather like me , is it not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be prepared to swear that it was you . &quot;
&quot; The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier , of Grenoble , who spent some days in doing the moulding .
It is a bust in wax .
The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this afternoon . &quot;
&quot; But why ? &quot;
&quot; Because , my dear Watson , I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; And you thought the rooms were watched ? &quot;
&quot; I knew that they were watched . &quot;
&quot; By whom ? &quot;
&quot; By my old enemies , Watson .
By the charming society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall .
You must remember that they knew , and only they knew , that I was still alive .
Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms .
They watched them continuously , and this morning they saw me arrive . &quot;
&quot; How do you know ? &quot;
&quot; Because I recognised their sentinel when I glanced out of my window .
He is a harmless enough fellow , Parker by name , a garroter by trade , and a remarkable performer upon the Jew &apos;s harp .
I cared nothing for him .
But I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him , the bosom friend of Moriarty , the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff , the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London .
That is the man who is after me tonight , Watson , and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him . &quot;
My friend &apos;s plans were gradually revealing themselves .
From this convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked .
That angular shadow up yonder was the bait and we were the hunters .
In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us .
Holmes was silent and motionless ; but I could tell that he was keenly alert , and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passersby .
It was a bleak and boisterous night , and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street .
Many people were moving to and fro , most of them muffled in their coats and cravats .
Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before , and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street .
I tried to draw my companion &apos;s attention to them , but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued to stare into the street .
More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall .
It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped .
At last , as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared , he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation .
I was about to make some remark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before .
I clutched Holmes &apos;s arm and pointed upwards .
&quot; The shadow has moved ! &quot;
I cried .
It was , indeed , no longer the profile , but the back , which was turned towards us .
Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own .
&quot; Of course it has moved , &quot; said he .
&quot; Am I such a farcical bungler , Watson , that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it ?
We have been in this room two hours , and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure eight times , or once in every quarter of an hour .
She works it from the front so that her shadow may never be seen .
Ah ! &quot;
He drew in his breath with a shrill , excited intake .
In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward , his whole attitude rigid with attention .
Outside , the street was absolutely deserted .
Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway , but I could no longer see them .
All was still and dark , save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre .
Again in the utter silence I heard that thin , sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement .
An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room , and I felt his warning hand upon my lips .
The fingers which clutched me were quivering .
Never had I known my friend more moved , and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us .
But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished .
A low , stealthy sound came to my ears , not from the direction of Baker Street , but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed .
A door opened and shut .
An instant later steps crept down the passagesteps which were meant to be silent , but which reverberated harshly through the empty house .
Holmes crouched back against the wall and I did the same , my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver .
Peering through the gloom , I saw the vague outline of a man , a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door .
He stood for an instant , and then he crept forward , crouching , menacing , into the room .
He was within three yards of us , this sinister figure , and I had braced myself to meet his spring , before I realized that he had no idea of our presence .
He passed close beside us , stole over to the window , and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot .
As he sank to the level of this opening the light of the street , no longer dimmed by the dusty glass , fell full upon his face .
The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement .
His two eyes shone like stars and his features were working convulsively .
He was an elderly man , with a thin , projecting nose , a high , bald forehead , and a huge grizzled moustache .
An operahat was pushed to the back of his head , and an evening dress shirtfront gleamed out through his open overcoat .
His face was gaunt and swarthy , scored with deep , savage lines .
In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick , but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang .
Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object , and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud , sharp click , as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place .
Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever , with the result that there came a long , whirling , grinding noise , ending once more in a powerful click .
He straightened himself then , and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun , with a curiously misshapen butt .
He opened it at the breech , put something in , and snapped the breechblock .
Then , crouching down , he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window , and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights .
I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder , and saw that amazing target , the black man on the yellow ground , standing clear at the end of his fore sight .
For an instant he was rigid and motionless .
Then his finger tightened on the trigger .
There was a strange , loud whiz and a long , silvery <unk> of broken glass .
At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the <unk> &apos;s back and <unk> him flat upon his face .
He was up again in a moment , and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat ; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped again upon the floor .
I fell upon him , and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle .
There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement , and two policemen in uniform , with one plainclothes detective , rushed through the front entrance and into the room .
&quot; That you , Lestrade ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Yes , Mr. Holmes .
I took the job myself .
It &apos;s good to see you back in London , sir . &quot;
&quot; I think you want a little unofficial help .
Three <unk> murders in one year won &apos;t do , Lestrade .
But you handled the <unk> Mystery with less than your <unk> &apos;s to say , you handled it fairly well . &quot;
We had all risen to our feet , our prisoner breathing hard , with a <unk> constable on each side of him .
Already a few <unk> had begun to collect in the street .
Holmes stepped up to the window , closed it , and dropped the <unk> .
Lestrade had produced two candles and the policemen had <unk> their <unk> .
I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner .
It was a <unk> <unk> and yet sinister face which was turned towards us .
With the brow of a <unk> above and the jaw of a <unk> below , the man must have started with great <unk> for good or for evil .
But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes , with their drooping , <unk> <unk> , or upon the fierce , aggressive nose and the threatening , deeplined brow , without reading Nature &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
He took no <unk> of any of us , but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes &apos;s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally <unk> .
&quot; You fiend ! &quot;
he kept on <unk> .
&quot; You clever , clever fiend ! &quot;
&quot; Ah , Colonel ! &quot;
said Holmes , <unk> his rumpled collar ; &quot; &apos; journeys end in <unk> &apos; <unk> , &apos; as the old play says .
I don &apos;t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you <unk> me with those <unk> as I lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall . &quot;
The Colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a <unk> .
&quot; You cunning , cunning fiend ! &quot;
was all that he could say .
&quot; I have not introduced you yet , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; This , gentlemen , is Colonel Sebastian Moran , once of Her <unk> &apos;s Indian Army , and the best heavy game shot that our <unk> <unk> has ever produced .
I believe I am correct , Colonel , in saying that your bag of tigers still remains <unk> ? &quot;
The fierce old man said nothing , but still glared at my companion ; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was <unk> like a tiger himself .
&quot; I wonder that my very simple <unk> could deceive so old a shikari , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; It must be very familiar to you .
Have you not <unk> a young <unk> under a tree , lain above it with your <unk> , and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger ?
This empty house is my tree and you are my tiger .
You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers , or in the unlikely supposition of your own <unk> <unk> you .
These , &quot; he pointed around , &quot; are my other guns .
The <unk> is exact . &quot;
Colonel Moran sprang forward , with a snarl of rage , but the constables dragged him back .
The fury upon his face was terrible to look at .
&quot; I confess that you had one small surprise for me , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I did not <unk> that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window .
I had imagined you as <unk> from the street , where my friend Lestrade and his <unk> men were awaiting you .
With that exception all has gone as I expected . &quot;
Colonel Moran turned to the official detective .
&quot; You may or may not have just cause for <unk> me , &quot; said he , &quot; but at least there can be no reason why I should <unk> to the <unk> of this person .
If I am in the hands of the law let things be done in a legal way . &quot;
&quot; Well , that &apos;s reasonable enough , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Nothing further you have to say , Mr. Holmes , before we go ? &quot;
Holmes had picked up the powerful airgun from the floor and was examining its <unk> .
&quot; An admirable and unique weapon , &quot; said he , &quot; <unk> and of tremendous power .
I knew Von Herder , the blind German mechanic , who <unk> it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty .
For years I have been aware of its existence , though I have never before had the opportunity of handling it .
I commend it very specially to your attention , Lestrade , and also the bullets which fit it . &quot;
&quot; You can trust us to look after that , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said Lestrade , as the whole party moved towards the door .
&quot; Anything further to say ? &quot;
&quot; Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer ? &quot;
&quot; What charge , sir ?
Why , of course , the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Not so , Lestrade .
I do not propose to appear in the matter at all .
To you , and to you only , belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected .
Yes , Lestrade , I congratulate you !
With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him . &quot;
&quot; Got him !
Got whom , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; The man that the whole force has been <unk> in <unk> Sebastian Moran , who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an airgun through the open window of the <unk> front of No .
427 , Park Lane , upon the <unk> of last month .
That &apos;s the charge , Lestrade .
And now , Watson , if you can endure the draught from a broken window , I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement . &quot;
Our old chambers had been left <unk> through the <unk> of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson .
As I entered I saw , it is true , an <unk> <unk> , but the old <unk> were all in their place .
There were the chemical corner and the <unk> , <unk> table .
There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrapbooks and books of reference which many of our <unk> would have been so glad to burn .
The <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> the <unk> <unk> which contained the tobaccoall met my eyes as I glanced round me .
There were two occupants of the <unk> Mrs. Hudson , who <unk> upon us both as we entered ; the other the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening &apos;s adventures .
It was a <unk> <unk> of my friend , so <unk> done that it was a perfect <unk> .
It stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressinggown of Holmes &apos;s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect .
&quot; I hope you preserved all <unk> , Mrs.
Hudson ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; I went to it on my knees , sir , just as you told me . &quot;
&quot; Excellent .
You carried the thing out very well .
Did you observe where the bullet went ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
I &apos;m afraid it has <unk> your beautiful bust , for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall .
I picked it up from the carpet .
Here it is ! &quot;
Holmes held it out to me .
&quot; A soft revolver bullet , as you perceive , Watson .
There &apos;s genius in that , for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun .
All right , Mrs. Hudson , I am much obliged for your assistance .
And now , Watson , let me see you in your old seat once more , for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you . &quot;
He had thrown off the seedy frockcoat , and now he was the Holmes of old in the <unk> dressinggown which he took from his <unk> .
&quot; The old shikari &apos;s nerves have not lost their <unk> nor his eyes their <unk> , &quot; said he , with a laugh , as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust .
&quot; <unk> in the middle of the back of the head and <unk> through the brain .
He was the best shot in India , and I expect that there are few better in London .
Have you heard the name ? &quot;
&quot; No , I have not . &quot;
&quot; Well , well , such is fame !
But , then , if I remember <unk> , you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty , who had one of the great brains of the century .
Just give me down my <unk> of <unk> from the shelf . &quot;
He turned over the pages <unk> , leaning back in his chair and blowing great <unk> from his cigar .
&quot; My collection of M &apos;s is a fine one , &quot; said he .
&quot; Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious , and here is <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> memory , and <unk> , who knocked out my left <unk> in the <unk> at Charing Cross , and , finally , here is our friend of tonight . &quot;
He handed over the book , and I read : Moran , Sebastian , Colonel .
<unk> .
<unk> 1st <unk> <unk> .
<unk> London , <unk> .
<unk> of Sir Augustus Moran , <unk> , once British Minister to Persia .
<unk> Eton and Oxford .
<unk> in <unk> Campaign , <unk> Campaign , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> ; Three <unk> in the <unk> , 1884 .
Address : <unk> Street .
<unk> : The <unk> , the <unk> , the Bagatelle <unk> <unk> .
On the margin was written , in Holmes &apos;s precise hand : The second most dangerous man in London .
&quot; This is astonishing , &quot; said I , as I handed back the volume .
&quot; The man &apos;s career is that of an honourable <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It is true , &quot; Holmes answered .
&quot; Up to a certain point he did well .
He was always a man of iron nerve , and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded <unk> tiger .
There are some trees , Watson , which grow to a certain height and then suddenly <unk> some <unk> <unk> .
You will see it often in <unk> .
I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole <unk> of his <unk> , and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his <unk> .
The person becomes , as it were , the <unk> of the history of his own family . &quot;
&quot; It is surely rather fanciful . &quot;
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t insist upon it .
Whatever the cause , Colonel Moran began to go wrong .
Without any open scandal he still made India too hot to hold him .
He retired , came to London , and again <unk> an evil name .
It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty , to whom for a time he was chief of the staff .
Moriarty supplied him <unk> with money and used him only in one or two very <unk> jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken .
You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. <unk> , of <unk> , in <unk> .
Not ?
Well , I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it ; but nothing could be proved .
So <unk> was the Colonel concealed that even when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could not <unk> him .
You remember at that date , when I called upon you in your rooms , how I put up the <unk> for fear of <unk> ?
No doubt you thought me fanciful .
I knew exactly what I was doing , for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun , and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it .
When we were in <unk> he followed us with Moriarty , and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge .
&quot; You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my <unk> in France , on the lookout for any chance of laying him by the heels .
So long as he was free in London my life would really not have been worth living .
<unk> and day the shadow would have been over me , and sooner or later his chance must have come .
What could I do ?
I could not shoot him at sight , or I should myself be in the <unk> .
There was no use <unk> to a <unk> .
They cannot <unk> on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion .
So I could do nothing .
But I watched the criminal news , knowing that sooner or later I should get him .
Then came the death of this Ronald Adair .
My chance had come at last !
Knowing what I did , was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it ?
He had played cards with the lad ; he had followed him home from the club ; he had shot him through the open window .
There was not a doubt of it .
The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a <unk> .
I came over at once .
I was seen by the sentinel , who would , I knew , direct the Colonel &apos;s attention to my presence .
He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed .
I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once , and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose .
I left him an excellent mark in the window , and , having warned the police that they might be <unk> the way , Watson , you spotted their presence in that doorway with <unk> <unk> took up what seemed to me to be a <unk> post for observation , never <unk> that he would choose the same spot for his attack .
Now , my dear Watson , does anything remain for me to explain ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; said I.
&quot; You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran &apos;s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
my dear Watson , there we come into those <unk> of <unk> where the most logical mind may be at fault .
Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence , and yours is as likely to be correct as mine . &quot;
&quot; You have formed one , then ? &quot;
&quot; I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts .
It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a considerable amount of money .
Now , Moran undoubtedly played <unk> that I have long been aware .
I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was <unk> .
Very likely he had spoken to him <unk> , and had threatened to expose him unless he <unk> resigned his <unk> of the club and promised not to play cards again .
It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by <unk> a wellknown man so much older than himself .
Probably he acted as I suggest .
The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran , who lived by his illgotten card gains .
He therefore murdered Adair , who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return , since he could not profit by his partner &apos;s foul play .
He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and <unk> .
Will it pass ? &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth . &quot;
&quot; It will be <unk> or <unk> at the trial .
Meanwhile , come what may , Colonel Moran will trouble us no more , the famous airgun of Von Herder will <unk> the Scotland Yard <unk> , and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so <unk> presents . &quot;
&quot; From the point of view of the criminal expert , &quot; said Mr. Sherlock Holmes , &quot; London has become a singularly <unk> city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty . &quot;
&quot; I can hardly think that you would find many decent <unk> to agree with you , &quot; I answered .
&quot; Well , well , I must not be selfish , &quot; said he , with a smile , as he pushed back his chair from the <unk> .
&quot; The community is certainly the <unk> , and no one the <unk> , save the poor <unk> specialist , whose <unk> has gone .
With that man in the field one &apos;s morning paper presented infinite possibilities .
<unk> it was only the <unk> trace , Watson , the <unk> indication , and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there , as the gentlest <unk> of the edges of the web <unk> one of the foul <unk> which <unk> in the centre .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole .
To the scientific student of the <unk> criminal world no capital in Europe offered the <unk> which London then possessed .
But now &quot; He shrugged his shoulders in <unk> <unk> of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce .
At the time of which I speak Holmes had been back for some months , and I , at his request , had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in Baker Street .
A young doctor , named Verner , had purchased my small Kensington practice , and given with <unk> little <unk> the highest price that I ventured to <unk> incident which only explained itself some years later when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes &apos;s , and that it was my friend who had really found the money .
Our months of partnership had not been so <unk> as he had stated , for I find , on looking over my notes , that this period includes the case of the papers of <unk> <unk> , and also the shocking affair of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which so nearly cost us both our lives .
His cold and proud nature was always <unk> , however , to anything in the shape of public applause , and he bound me in the most <unk> terms to say no further word of himself , his methods , or his <unk> prohibition which , as I have explained , has only now been removed .
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> his morning paper in a <unk> fashion , when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell , followed immediately by a <unk> <unk> sound , as if someone were <unk> on the outer door with his fist .
As it opened there came a <unk> <unk> into the hall , rapid feet <unk> up the stair , and an instant later a <unk> and frantic young man , pale , <unk> , and <unk> , burst into the room .
He looked from one to the other of us , and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this <unk> entry .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Holmes , &quot; he cried .
&quot; You <unk> &apos;t blame me .
I am nearly mad .
Mr. Holmes , I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane . &quot;
He made the <unk> as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner ; but I could see by my companion &apos;s <unk> face that it meant no more to him than to me .
&quot; Have a cigarette , Mr. McFarlane , &quot; said he , pushing his case across .
&quot; I am sure that with your <unk> my friend Dr. Watson here would <unk> a <unk> .
The weather has been so very warm these last few days .
Now , if you feel a little more composed , I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is that you want .
You mentioned your name as if I should recognise it , but I assure you that , beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor , a solicitor , a <unk> , and an <unk> , I know nothing whatever about you . &quot;
<unk> as I was with my friend &apos;s methods , it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions , and to observe the untidiness of attire , the sheaf of legal papers , the <unk> , and the breathing which had <unk> them .
Our client , however , stared in amazement .
&quot; Yes , I am all that , Mr. Holmes , and in addition I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in London .
For Heaven &apos;s sake don &apos;t abandon me , Mr. Holmes !
If they come to arrest me before I have finished my story , make them give me time so that I may tell you the whole truth .
I could go to jail happy if I knew that you were working for me outside . &quot;
&quot; Arrest you ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; This is really most <unk> interesting .
On what charge do you expect to be arrested ? &quot;
&quot; Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre , of Lower Norwood . &quot;
My companion &apos;s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not , I am afraid , entirely <unk> with satisfaction .
&quot; Dear me , &quot; said he ; &quot; it was only this moment at breakfast that I was saying to my friend , Dr. Watson , that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers . &quot;
Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the Daily Telegraph , which still lay upon Holmes &apos;s knee .
&quot; If you had looked at it , sir , you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning .
I feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man &apos;s mouth . &quot;
He turned it over to expose the central page .
&quot; Here it is , and with your permission I will read it to you .
Listen to this , Mr. Holmes .
The headlines are : &apos; <unk> <unk> at Lower Norwood .
Disappearance of a <unk> <unk> .
Suspicion of Murder and <unk> .
A <unk> to the <unk> . &apos;
That is the clue which they are already following , Mr. Holmes , and I know that it leads <unk> to me .
I have been followed from London Bridge Station , and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me .
It will break my mother &apos;s <unk> will break her heart ! &quot;
He wrung his hands in an agony of <unk> , and <unk> backwards and forwards in his chair .
I looked with interest upon this man , who was <unk> of being the <unk> of a crime of violence .
He was flaxenhaired and handsome in a <unk> negative fashion , with frightened blue eyes and a cleanshaven face , with a weak , sensitive mouth .
His age may have been about <unk> ; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman .
From the pocket of his light summer overcoat <unk> the bundle of <unk> papers which <unk> his profession .
&quot; We must use what time we have , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Watson , would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in question ? &quot;
<unk> the vigorous headlines which our client had <unk> I read the following suggestive narrative : &quot; Late last night , or early this morning , an incident occurred at Lower Norwood which points , it is feared , to a serious crime .
Mr. Jonas Oldacre is a wellknown <unk> of that <unk> , where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years .
Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor , <unk> years of age , and lives in Deep Dene House , at the Sydenham end of the road of that name .
He has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits , secretive and <unk> .
For some years he has practically withdrawn from the business , in which he is said to have <unk> considerable wealth .
A small timberyard still <unk> , however , at the back of the house , and last night , about twelve o &apos;clock , an alarm was given that one of the <unk> was on fire .
The <unk> were soon upon the spot , but the dry wood burned with great fury , and it was impossible to arrest the <unk> until the <unk> had been entirely consumed .
Up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident , but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime .
<unk> was <unk> at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire , and an inquiry followed , which showed that he had disappeared from the house .
An examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in , that a safe which stood in it was open , that a number of important papers were scattered about the room , and , finally , that there were signs of a murderous struggle , slight traces of blood being found within the room , and an oaken <unk> , which also showed stains of blood upon the handle .
It is known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night , and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person , who is a young London solicitor named John Hector McFarlane , <unk> partner of <unk> and McFarlane , of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
The police believe that they have evidence in their possession which <unk> a very convincing motive for the crime , and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow .
&quot; <unk> is <unk> as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre .
It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued .
There have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at Norwood .
Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom ( which is on the ground floor ) were found to be open , that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the woodpile , and , finally , it is <unk> that charred remains have been found among the <unk> ashes of the fire .
The police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed , that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom , his papers rifled , and his dead body dragged across to the <unk> , which was then <unk> so as to hide all traces of the crime .
The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and <unk> . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and <unk> together to this remarkable account .
&quot; The case has certainly some points of interest , &quot; said he , in his <unk> fashion .
&quot; May I ask , in the first place , Mr. McFarlane , how it is that you are still at liberty , since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest ? &quot;
&quot; I live at <unk> Lodge , Blackheath , with my parents , Mr. Holmes ; but last night , having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre , I stayed at an hotel in Norwood , and came to my business from there .
I knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train , when I read what you have just heard .
I at once saw the horrible danger of my position , and I hurried to put the case into your hands .
I have no doubt that I should have been arrested either at my City office or at my home .
A man followed me from London Bridge Station , and I have no <unk> Heaven , what is that ? &quot;
It was a clang of the bell , followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair .
A moment later our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway .
Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside .
&quot; Mr. John Hector McFarlane ? &quot;
said Lestrade .
Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face .
&quot; I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre , of Lower Norwood . &quot;
McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair , and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed .
&quot; One moment , Lestrade , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Half an hour more or less can make no difference to you , and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair , which might aid us in clearing it up . &quot;
&quot; I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up , &quot; said Lestrade , <unk> .
&quot; None the less , with your permission , I should be much interested to hear his account . &quot;
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , it is difficult for me to refuse you anything , for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past , and we owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard , &quot; said Lestrade .
