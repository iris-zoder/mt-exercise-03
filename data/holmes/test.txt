It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested , and the fashionable world dismayed , by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances .
The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation ; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion , since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts .
Only now , at the end of nearly ten years , am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain .
The crime was of interest in itself , but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel , which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life .
Even now , after this long interval , I find myself thrilling as I think of it , and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy , amazement , and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind .
Let me say to that public which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them , for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips , which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month .
It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime , and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public , and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution , though with indifferent success .
There was none , however , which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair .
As I read the evidence at the inquest , which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown , I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes .
There were points about this strange business which would , I was sure , have specially appealed to him , and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented , or more probably anticipated , by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe .
All day as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind , and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate .
At the risk of telling a twicetold tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest .
The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth , at that time Governor of one of the Australian Colonies .
Adair &apos;s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract , and she , her son Ronald , and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427 , Park Lane .
The youth moved in the best society , had , so far as was known , no enemies , and no particular vices .
He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley , of Carstairs , but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before , and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it .
For the rest the man &apos;s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle , for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional .
Yet it was upon this easygoing young aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleventwenty on the night of March 30 , 1894 .
Ronald Adair was fond of cards , playing continually , but never for such stakes as would hurt him .
He was a member of the Baldwin , the Cavendish , and the Bagatelle card clubs .
It was shown that after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club .
He had also played there in the afternoon .
The evidence of those who had played with himMr .
Murray , Sir John Hardy , and Colonel Moranshowed that the game was whist , and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards .
Adair might have lost five pounds , but not more .
His fortune was a considerable one , and such a loss could not in any way affect him .
He had played nearly every day at one club or other , but he was a cautious player , and usually rose a winner .
It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral .
So much for his recent history , as it came out at the inquest .
On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten .
His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation .
The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor , generally used as his sittingroom .
She had lit a fire there , and as it smoked she had opened the window .
No sound was heard from the room until eleventwenty , the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter .
Desiring to say goodnight , she had attempted to enter her son &apos;s room .
The door was locked on the inside , and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking .
Help was obtained and the door forced .
The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table .
His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet , but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room .
On the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold , the money arranged in little piles of varying amount .
There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite to them , from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards .
A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex .
In the first place , no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside .
There was the possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped by the window .
The drop was at least twenty feet , however , and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath .
Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed , nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road .
Apparently , therefore , it was the young man himself who had fastened the door .
But how did he come by his death ?
No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces .
Suppose a man had fired through the window , it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound .
Again , Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare , and there is a cabstand within a hundred yards of the house .
No one had heard a shot .
And yet there was the dead man , and there the revolver bullet , which had mushroomed out , as softnosed bullets will , and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death .
Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery , which were further complicated by entire absence of motive , since , as I have said , young Adair was not known to have any enemy , and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room .
All day I turned these facts over in my mind , endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all , and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the startingpoint of every investigation .
I confess that I made little progress .
In the evening I strolled across the Park , and found myself about six o &apos;clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane .
A group of loafers upon the pavements , all staring up at a particular window , directed me to the house which I had come to see .
A tall , thin man with coloured glasses , whom I strongly suspected of being a plainclothes detective , was pointing out some theory of his own , while the others crowded round to listen to what he said .
I got as near him as I could , but his observations seemed to me to be absurd , so I withdrew again in some disgust .
As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man , who had been behind me , and I knocked down several books which he was carrying .
I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of one of them , The Origin of Tree Worship , and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who , either as a trade or as a hobby , was a collector of obscure volumes .
I endeavoured to apologize for the accident , but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner .
With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel , and I saw his curved back and white sidewhiskers disappear among the throng .
My observations of No .
427 , Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested .
The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing , the whole not more than five feet high .
It was perfectly easy , therefore , for anyone to get into the garden , but the window was entirely inaccessible , since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it .
More puzzled than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington .
I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me .
To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old bookcollector , his sharp , wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair , and his precious volumes , a dozen of them at least , wedged under his right arm .
&quot; You &apos;re surprised to see me , sir , &quot; said he , in a strange , croaking voice .
I acknowledged that I was .
&quot; Well , I &apos;ve a conscience , sir , and when I chanced to see you go into this house , as I came hobbling after you , I thought to myself , I &apos;ll just step in and see that kind gentleman , and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant , and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books . &quot;
&quot; You make too much of a trifle , &quot; said I.
&quot; May I ask how you knew who I was ? &quot;
&quot; Well , sir , if it isn &apos;t too great a liberty , I am a neighbour of yours , for you &apos;ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street , and very happy to see you , I am sure .
Maybe you collect yourself , sir ; here &apos;s British Birds , and Catullus , and The Holy Wara bargain every one of them .
With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf .
It looks untidy , does it not , sir ? &quot;
I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me .
When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table .
I rose to my feet , stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement , and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life .
Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes , and when it cleared I found my collarends undone and the tingling aftertaste of brandy upon my lips .
Holmes was bending over my chair , his flask in his hand .
&quot; My dear Watson , &quot; said the wellremembered voice , &quot; I owe you a thousand apologies .
I had no idea that you would be so affected . &quot;
I gripped him by the arm .
&quot; Holmes ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; Is it really you ?
Can it indeed be that you are alive ?
Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss ? &quot;
&quot; Wait a moment , &quot; said he .
&quot; Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things ?
I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance . &quot;
&quot; I am all right , but indeed , Holmes , I can hardly believe my eyes .
Good heavens , to think that youyou of all menshould be standing in my study ! &quot;
Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin , sinewy arm beneath it .
&quot; Well , you &apos;re not a spirit , anyhow , &quot; said I.
&quot; My dear chap , I am overjoyed to see you .
Sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm . &quot;
He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner .
He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant , but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table .
Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old , but there was a deadwhite tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one .
&quot; I am glad to stretch myself , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end .
Now , my dear fellow , in the matter of these explanations we have , if I may ask for your cooperation , a hard and dangerous night &apos;s work in front of us .
Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished . &quot;
&quot; I am full of curiosity .
I should much prefer to hear now . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll come with me tonight ? &quot;
&quot; When you like and where you like . &quot;
&quot; This is indeed like the old days .
We shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go .
Well , then , about that chasm .
I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it , for the very simple reason that I never was in it . &quot;
&quot; You never were in it ? &quot;
&quot; No , Watson , I never was in it .
My note to you was absolutely genuine .
I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety .
I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes .
I exchanged some remarks with him , therefore , and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received .
I left it with my cigarettebox and my stick and I walked along the pathway , Moriarty still at my heels .
When I reached the end I stood at bay .
He drew no weapon , but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me .
He knew that his own game was up , and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me .
We tottered together upon the brink of the fall .
I have some knowledge , however , of baritsu , or the Japanese system of wrestling , which has more than once been very useful to me .
I slipped through his grip , and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands .
But for all his efforts he could not get his balance , and over he went .
With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way .
Then he struck a rock , bounded off , and splashed into the water . &quot;
I listened with amazement to this explanation , which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette .
&quot; But the tracks ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; I saw with my own eyes that two went down the path and none returned . &quot;
&quot; It came about in this way .
The instant that the Professor had disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way .
I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death .
There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader .
They were all most dangerous men .
One or other would certainly get me .
On the other hand , if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties , these men , they would lay themselves open , and sooner or later I could destroy them .
Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living .
So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall .
&quot; I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me .
In your picturesque account of the matter , which I read with great interest some months later , you assert that the wall was sheer .
This was not literally true .
A few small footholds presented themselves , and there was some indication of a ledge .
The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility , and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks .
I might , it is true , have reversed my boots , as I have done on similar occasions , but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception .
On the whole , then , it was best that I should risk the climb .
It was not a pleasant business , Watson .
The fall roared beneath me .
I am not a fanciful person , but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty &apos;s voice screaming at me out of the abyss .
A mistake would have been fatal .
More than once , as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock , I thought that I was gone .
But I struggled upwards , and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss , where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort .
There I was stretched when you , my dear Watson , and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death .
&quot; At last , when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions , you departed for the hotel and I was left alone .
I had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures , but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me .
A huge rock , falling from above , boomed past me , struck the path , and bounded over into the chasm .
For an instant I thought that it was an accident ; but a moment later , looking up , I saw a man &apos;s head against the darkening sky , and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched , within a foot of my head .
Of course , the meaning of this was obvious .
Moriarty had not been alone .
A confederateand even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate washad kept guard while the Professor had attacked me .
From a distance , unseen by me , he had been a witness of his friend &apos;s death and of my escape .
He had waited , and then , making his way round to the top of the cliff , he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed .
&quot; I did not take long to think about it , Watson .
Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff , and I knew that it was the precursor of another stone .
I scrambled down on to the path .
I don &apos;t think I could have done it in cold blood .
It was a hundred times more difficult than getting up .
But I had no time to think of the danger , for another stone sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge .
Halfway down I slipped , but by the blessing of God I landed , torn and bleeding , upon the path .
I took to my heels , did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness , and a week later I found myself in Florence with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me .
&quot; I had only one confidantmy brother Mycroft .
I owe you many apologies , my dear Watson , but it was allimportant that it should be thought I was dead , and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true .
Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you , but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret .
For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books , for I was in danger at the time , and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results .
As to Mycroft , I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed .
The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped , for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members , my own most vindictive enemies , at liberty .
I travelled for two years in Tibet , therefore , and amused myself by visiting Lhassa and spending some days with the head Llama .
You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson , but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend .
I then passed through Persia , looked in at Mecca , and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum , the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office .
Returning to France I spent some months in a research into the coaltar derivatives , which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier , in the South of France .
Having concluded this to my satisfaction , and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London , I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery , which not only appealed to me by its own merits , but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities .
I came over at once to London , called in my own person at Baker Street , threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics , and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been .
So it was , my dear Watson , that at two o &apos;clock today I found myself in my old armchair in my own old room , and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned . &quot;
Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April eveninga narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall , spare figure and the keen , eager face , which I had never thought to see again .
In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement , and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words .
&quot; Work is the best antidote to sorrow , my dear Watson , &quot; said he , &quot; and I have a piece of work for us both tonight which , if we can bring it to a successful conclusion , will in itself justify a man &apos;s life on this planet . &quot;
In vain I begged him to tell me more .
&quot; You will hear and see enough before morning , &quot; he answered .
&quot; We have three years of the past to discuss .
Let that suffice until halfpast nine , when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house . &quot;
It was indeed like old times when , at that hour , I found myself seated beside him in a hansom , my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of adventure in my heart .
Holmes was cold and stern and silent .
As the gleam of the streetlamps flashed upon his austere features I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed .
I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London , but I was well assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one , while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest .
I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street , but Holmes stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square .
I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left , and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed .
Our route was certainly a singular one .
Holmes &apos;s knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary , and on this occasion he passed rapidly , and with an assured step , through a network of mews and stables the very existence of which I had never known .
We emerged at last into a small road , lined with old , gloomy houses , which led us into Manchester Street , and so to Blandford Street .
Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage , passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard , and then opened with a key the back door of a house .
We entered together and he closed it behind us .
The place was pitchdark , but it was evident to me that it was an empty house .
Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking , and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons .
Holmes &apos;s cold , thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forwards down a long hall , until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door .
Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right , and we found ourselves in a large , square , empty room , heavily shadowed in the corners , but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond .
There was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust , so that we could only just discern each other &apos;s figures within .
My companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear .
&quot; Do you know where we are ? &quot;
he whispered .
&quot; Surely that is Baker Street , &quot; I answered , staring through the dim window .
&quot; Exactly .
We are in Camden House , which stands opposite to our own old quarters . &quot;
&quot; But why are we here ? &quot;
&quot; Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile .
Might I trouble you , my dear Watson , to draw a little nearer to the window , taking every precaution not to show yourself , and then to look up at our old roomsthe startingpoint of so many of our little adventures ?
We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you . &quot;
I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window .
As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement .
The blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room .
The shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard , black outline upon the luminous screen of the window .
There was no mistaking the poise of the head , the squareness of the shoulders , the sharpness of the features .
The face was turned halfround , and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame .
It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes .
So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me .
He was quivering with silent laughter .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; Good heavens ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; It is marvellous . &quot;
&quot; I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety , &apos; &quot; said he , and I recognised in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation .
&quot; It really is rather like me , is it not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be prepared to swear that it was you . &quot;
&quot; The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier , of Grenoble , who spent some days in doing the moulding .
It is a bust in wax .
The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this afternoon . &quot;
&quot; But why ? &quot;
&quot; Because , my dear Watson , I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; And you thought the rooms were watched ? &quot;
&quot; I knew that they were watched . &quot;
&quot; By whom ? &quot;
&quot; By my old enemies , Watson .
By the charming society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall .
You must remember that they knew , and only they knew , that I was still alive .
Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms .
They watched them continuously , and this morning they saw me arrive . &quot;
&quot; How do you know ? &quot;
&quot; Because I recognised their sentinel when I glanced out of my window .
He is a harmless enough fellow , Parker by name , a garroter by trade , and a remarkable performer upon the Jew &apos;s harp .
I cared nothing for him .
But I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him , the bosom friend of Moriarty , the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff , the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London .
That is the man who is after me tonight , Watson , and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him . &quot;
My friend &apos;s plans were gradually revealing themselves .
From this convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked .
That angular shadow up yonder was the bait and we were the hunters .
In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us .
Holmes was silent and motionless ; but I could tell that he was keenly alert , and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passersby .
It was a bleak and boisterous night , and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street .
Many people were moving to and fro , most of them muffled in their coats and cravats .
Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before , and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street .
I tried to draw my companion &apos;s attention to them , but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued to stare into the street .
More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall .
It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped .
At last , as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared , he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation .
I was about to make some remark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before .
I clutched Holmes &apos;s arm and pointed upwards .
&quot; The shadow has moved ! &quot;
I cried .
It was , indeed , no longer the profile , but the back , which was turned towards us .
Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own .
&quot; Of course it has moved , &quot; said he .
&quot; Am I such a farcical bungler , Watson , that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it ?
We have been in this room two hours , and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure eight times , or once in every quarter of an hour .
She works it from the front so that her shadow may never be seen .
Ah ! &quot;
He drew in his breath with a shrill , excited intake .
In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward , his whole attitude rigid with attention .
Outside , the street was absolutely deserted .
Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway , but I could no longer see them .
All was still and dark , save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre .
Again in the utter silence I heard that thin , sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement .
An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room , and I felt his warning hand upon my lips .
The fingers which clutched me were quivering .
Never had I known my friend more moved , and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us .
But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished .
A low , stealthy sound came to my ears , not from the direction of Baker Street , but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed .
A door opened and shut .
An instant later steps crept down the passagesteps which were meant to be silent , but which reverberated harshly through the empty house .
Holmes crouched back against the wall and I did the same , my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver .
Peering through the gloom , I saw the vague outline of a man , a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door .
He stood for an instant , and then he crept forward , crouching , menacing , into the room .
He was within three yards of us , this sinister figure , and I had braced myself to meet his spring , before I realized that he had no idea of our presence .
He passed close beside us , stole over to the window , and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot .
As he sank to the level of this opening the light of the street , no longer dimmed by the dusty glass , fell full upon his face .
The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement .
His two eyes shone like stars and his features were working convulsively .
He was an elderly man , with a thin , projecting nose , a high , bald forehead , and a huge grizzled moustache .
An operahat was pushed to the back of his head , and an evening dress shirtfront gleamed out through his open overcoat .
His face was gaunt and swarthy , scored with deep , savage lines .
In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick , but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang .
Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object , and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud , sharp click , as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place .
Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever , with the result that there came a long , whirling , grinding noise , ending once more in a powerful click .
He straightened himself then , and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun , with a curiously misshapen butt .
He opened it at the breech , put something in , and snapped the breechblock .
Then , crouching down , he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window , and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights .
I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder , and saw that amazing target , the black man on the yellow ground , standing clear at the end of his fore sight .
For an instant he was rigid and motionless .
Then his finger tightened on the trigger .
There was a strange , loud whiz and a long , silvery <unk> of broken glass .
At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the <unk> &apos;s back and <unk> him flat upon his face .
He was up again in a moment , and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat ; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped again upon the floor .
I fell upon him , and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle .
There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement , and two policemen in uniform , with one plainclothes detective , rushed through the front entrance and into the room .
&quot; That you , Lestrade ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Yes , Mr. Holmes .
I took the job myself .
It &apos;s good to see you back in London , sir . &quot;
&quot; I think you want a little unofficial help .
Three <unk> murders in one year won &apos;t do , Lestrade .
But you handled the <unk> Mystery with less than your <unk> &apos;s to say , you handled it fairly well . &quot;
We had all risen to our feet , our prisoner breathing hard , with a <unk> constable on each side of him .
Already a few <unk> had begun to collect in the street .
Holmes stepped up to the window , closed it , and dropped the <unk> .
Lestrade had produced two candles and the policemen had <unk> their <unk> .
I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner .
It was a <unk> <unk> and yet sinister face which was turned towards us .
With the brow of a <unk> above and the jaw of a <unk> below , the man must have started with great <unk> for good or for evil .
But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes , with their drooping , <unk> <unk> , or upon the fierce , aggressive nose and the threatening , deeplined brow , without reading Nature &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
He took no <unk> of any of us , but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes &apos;s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally <unk> .
&quot; You fiend ! &quot;
he kept on <unk> .
&quot; You clever , clever fiend ! &quot;
&quot; Ah , Colonel ! &quot;
said Holmes , <unk> his rumpled collar ; &quot; &apos; journeys end in <unk> &apos; <unk> , &apos; as the old play says .
I don &apos;t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you <unk> me with those <unk> as I lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall . &quot;
The Colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a <unk> .
&quot; You cunning , cunning fiend ! &quot;
was all that he could say .
&quot; I have not introduced you yet , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; This , gentlemen , is Colonel Sebastian Moran , once of Her <unk> &apos;s Indian Army , and the best heavy game shot that our <unk> <unk> has ever produced .
I believe I am correct , Colonel , in saying that your bag of tigers still remains <unk> ? &quot;
The fierce old man said nothing , but still glared at my companion ; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was <unk> like a tiger himself .
&quot; I wonder that my very simple <unk> could deceive so old a shikari , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; It must be very familiar to you .
Have you not <unk> a young <unk> under a tree , lain above it with your <unk> , and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger ?
This empty house is my tree and you are my tiger .
You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers , or in the unlikely supposition of your own <unk> <unk> you .
These , &quot; he pointed around , &quot; are my other guns .
The <unk> is exact . &quot;
Colonel Moran sprang forward , with a snarl of rage , but the constables dragged him back .
The fury upon his face was terrible to look at .
&quot; I confess that you had one small surprise for me , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I did not <unk> that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window .
I had imagined you as <unk> from the street , where my friend Lestrade and his <unk> men were awaiting you .
With that exception all has gone as I expected . &quot;
Colonel Moran turned to the official detective .
&quot; You may or may not have just cause for <unk> me , &quot; said he , &quot; but at least there can be no reason why I should <unk> to the <unk> of this person .
If I am in the hands of the law let things be done in a legal way . &quot;
&quot; Well , that &apos;s reasonable enough , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Nothing further you have to say , Mr. Holmes , before we go ? &quot;
Holmes had picked up the powerful airgun from the floor and was examining its <unk> .
&quot; An admirable and unique weapon , &quot; said he , &quot; <unk> and of tremendous power .
I knew Von Herder , the blind German mechanic , who <unk> it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty .
For years I have been aware of its existence , though I have never before had the opportunity of handling it .
I commend it very specially to your attention , Lestrade , and also the bullets which fit it . &quot;
&quot; You can trust us to look after that , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said Lestrade , as the whole party moved towards the door .
&quot; Anything further to say ? &quot;
&quot; Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer ? &quot;
&quot; What charge , sir ?
Why , of course , the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Not so , Lestrade .
I do not propose to appear in the matter at all .
To you , and to you only , belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected .
Yes , Lestrade , I congratulate you !
With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him . &quot;
&quot; Got him !
Got whom , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; The man that the whole force has been <unk> in <unk> Sebastian Moran , who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an airgun through the open window of the <unk> front of No .
427 , Park Lane , upon the <unk> of last month .
That &apos;s the charge , Lestrade .
And now , Watson , if you can endure the draught from a broken window , I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement . &quot;
Our old chambers had been left <unk> through the <unk> of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson .
As I entered I saw , it is true , an <unk> <unk> , but the old <unk> were all in their place .
There were the chemical corner and the <unk> , <unk> table .
There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrapbooks and books of reference which many of our <unk> would have been so glad to burn .
The <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> the <unk> <unk> which contained the tobaccoall met my eyes as I glanced round me .
There were two occupants of the <unk> Mrs. Hudson , who <unk> upon us both as we entered ; the other the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening &apos;s adventures .
It was a <unk> <unk> of my friend , so <unk> done that it was a perfect <unk> .
It stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressinggown of Holmes &apos;s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect .
&quot; I hope you preserved all <unk> , Mrs.
Hudson ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; I went to it on my knees , sir , just as you told me . &quot;
&quot; Excellent .
You carried the thing out very well .
Did you observe where the bullet went ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
I &apos;m afraid it has <unk> your beautiful bust , for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall .
I picked it up from the carpet .
Here it is ! &quot;
Holmes held it out to me .
&quot; A soft revolver bullet , as you perceive , Watson .
There &apos;s genius in that , for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun .
All right , Mrs. Hudson , I am much obliged for your assistance .
And now , Watson , let me see you in your old seat once more , for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you . &quot;
He had thrown off the seedy frockcoat , and now he was the Holmes of old in the <unk> dressinggown which he took from his <unk> .
&quot; The old shikari &apos;s nerves have not lost their <unk> nor his eyes their <unk> , &quot; said he , with a laugh , as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust .
&quot; <unk> in the middle of the back of the head and <unk> through the brain .
He was the best shot in India , and I expect that there are few better in London .
Have you heard the name ? &quot;
&quot; No , I have not . &quot;
&quot; Well , well , such is fame !
But , then , if I remember <unk> , you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty , who had one of the great brains of the century .
Just give me down my <unk> of <unk> from the shelf . &quot;
He turned over the pages <unk> , leaning back in his chair and blowing great <unk> from his cigar .
&quot; My collection of M &apos;s is a fine one , &quot; said he .
&quot; Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious , and here is <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> memory , and <unk> , who knocked out my left <unk> in the <unk> at Charing Cross , and , finally , here is our friend of tonight . &quot;
He handed over the book , and I read : Moran , Sebastian , Colonel .
<unk> .
<unk> 1st <unk> <unk> .
<unk> London , <unk> .
<unk> of Sir Augustus Moran , <unk> , once British Minister to Persia .
<unk> Eton and Oxford .
<unk> in <unk> Campaign , <unk> Campaign , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> ; Three <unk> in the <unk> , 1884 .
Address : <unk> Street .
<unk> : The <unk> , the <unk> , the Bagatelle <unk> <unk> .
On the margin was written , in Holmes &apos;s precise hand : The second most dangerous man in London .
&quot; This is astonishing , &quot; said I , as I handed back the volume .
&quot; The man &apos;s career is that of an honourable <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It is true , &quot; Holmes answered .
&quot; Up to a certain point he did well .
He was always a man of iron nerve , and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded <unk> tiger .
There are some trees , Watson , which grow to a certain height and then suddenly <unk> some <unk> <unk> .
You will see it often in <unk> .
I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole <unk> of his <unk> , and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his <unk> .
The person becomes , as it were , the <unk> of the history of his own family . &quot;
&quot; It is surely rather fanciful . &quot;
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t insist upon it .
Whatever the cause , Colonel Moran began to go wrong .
Without any open scandal he still made India too hot to hold him .
He retired , came to London , and again <unk> an evil name .
It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty , to whom for a time he was chief of the staff .
Moriarty supplied him <unk> with money and used him only in one or two very <unk> jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken .
You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. <unk> , of <unk> , in <unk> .
Not ?
Well , I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it ; but nothing could be proved .
So <unk> was the Colonel concealed that even when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could not <unk> him .
You remember at that date , when I called upon you in your rooms , how I put up the <unk> for fear of <unk> ?
No doubt you thought me fanciful .
I knew exactly what I was doing , for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun , and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it .
When we were in <unk> he followed us with Moriarty , and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge .
&quot; You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my <unk> in France , on the lookout for any chance of laying him by the heels .
So long as he was free in London my life would really not have been worth living .
<unk> and day the shadow would have been over me , and sooner or later his chance must have come .
What could I do ?
I could not shoot him at sight , or I should myself be in the <unk> .
There was no use <unk> to a <unk> .
They cannot <unk> on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion .
So I could do nothing .
But I watched the criminal news , knowing that sooner or later I should get him .
Then came the death of this Ronald Adair .
My chance had come at last !
Knowing what I did , was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it ?
He had played cards with the lad ; he had followed him home from the club ; he had shot him through the open window .
There was not a doubt of it .
The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a <unk> .
I came over at once .
I was seen by the sentinel , who would , I knew , direct the Colonel &apos;s attention to my presence .
He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed .
I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once , and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose .
I left him an excellent mark in the window , and , having warned the police that they might be <unk> the way , Watson , you spotted their presence in that doorway with <unk> <unk> took up what seemed to me to be a <unk> post for observation , never <unk> that he would choose the same spot for his attack .
Now , my dear Watson , does anything remain for me to explain ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; said I.
&quot; You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran &apos;s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
my dear Watson , there we come into those <unk> of <unk> where the most logical mind may be at fault .
Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence , and yours is as likely to be correct as mine . &quot;
&quot; You have formed one , then ? &quot;
&quot; I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts .
It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a considerable amount of money .
Now , Moran undoubtedly played <unk> that I have long been aware .
I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was <unk> .
Very likely he had spoken to him <unk> , and had threatened to expose him unless he <unk> resigned his <unk> of the club and promised not to play cards again .
It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by <unk> a wellknown man so much older than himself .
Probably he acted as I suggest .
The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran , who lived by his illgotten card gains .
He therefore murdered Adair , who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return , since he could not profit by his partner &apos;s foul play .
He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and <unk> .
Will it pass ? &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth . &quot;
&quot; It will be <unk> or <unk> at the trial .
Meanwhile , come what may , Colonel Moran will trouble us no more , the famous airgun of Von Herder will <unk> the Scotland Yard <unk> , and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so <unk> presents . &quot;
&quot; From the point of view of the criminal expert , &quot; said Mr. Sherlock Holmes , &quot; London has become a singularly <unk> city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty . &quot;
&quot; I can hardly think that you would find many decent <unk> to agree with you , &quot; I answered .
&quot; Well , well , I must not be selfish , &quot; said he , with a smile , as he pushed back his chair from the <unk> .
&quot; The community is certainly the <unk> , and no one the <unk> , save the poor <unk> specialist , whose <unk> has gone .
With that man in the field one &apos;s morning paper presented infinite possibilities .
<unk> it was only the <unk> trace , Watson , the <unk> indication , and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there , as the gentlest <unk> of the edges of the web <unk> one of the foul <unk> which <unk> in the centre .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole .
To the scientific student of the <unk> criminal world no capital in Europe offered the <unk> which London then possessed .
But now &quot; He shrugged his shoulders in <unk> <unk> of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce .
At the time of which I speak Holmes had been back for some months , and I , at his request , had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in Baker Street .
A young doctor , named Verner , had purchased my small Kensington practice , and given with <unk> little <unk> the highest price that I ventured to <unk> incident which only explained itself some years later when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes &apos;s , and that it was my friend who had really found the money .
Our months of partnership had not been so <unk> as he had stated , for I find , on looking over my notes , that this period includes the case of the papers of <unk> <unk> , and also the shocking affair of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which so nearly cost us both our lives .
His cold and proud nature was always <unk> , however , to anything in the shape of public applause , and he bound me in the most <unk> terms to say no further word of himself , his methods , or his <unk> prohibition which , as I have explained , has only now been removed .
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> his morning paper in a <unk> fashion , when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell , followed immediately by a <unk> <unk> sound , as if someone were <unk> on the outer door with his fist .
As it opened there came a <unk> <unk> into the hall , rapid feet <unk> up the stair , and an instant later a <unk> and frantic young man , pale , <unk> , and <unk> , burst into the room .
He looked from one to the other of us , and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this <unk> entry .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Holmes , &quot; he cried .
&quot; You <unk> &apos;t blame me .
I am nearly mad .
Mr. Holmes , I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane . &quot;
He made the <unk> as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner ; but I could see by my companion &apos;s <unk> face that it meant no more to him than to me .
&quot; Have a cigarette , Mr. McFarlane , &quot; said he , pushing his case across .
&quot; I am sure that with your <unk> my friend Dr. Watson here would <unk> a <unk> .
The weather has been so very warm these last few days .
Now , if you feel a little more composed , I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is that you want .
You mentioned your name as if I should recognise it , but I assure you that , beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor , a solicitor , a <unk> , and an <unk> , I know nothing whatever about you . &quot;
<unk> as I was with my friend &apos;s methods , it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions , and to observe the untidiness of attire , the sheaf of legal papers , the <unk> , and the breathing which had <unk> them .
Our client , however , stared in amazement .
&quot; Yes , I am all that , Mr. Holmes , and in addition I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in London .
For Heaven &apos;s sake don &apos;t abandon me , Mr. Holmes !
If they come to arrest me before I have finished my story , make them give me time so that I may tell you the whole truth .
I could go to jail happy if I knew that you were working for me outside . &quot;
&quot; Arrest you ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; This is really most <unk> interesting .
On what charge do you expect to be arrested ? &quot;
&quot; Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre , of Lower Norwood . &quot;
My companion &apos;s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not , I am afraid , entirely <unk> with satisfaction .
&quot; Dear me , &quot; said he ; &quot; it was only this moment at breakfast that I was saying to my friend , Dr. Watson , that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers . &quot;
Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the Daily Telegraph , which still lay upon Holmes &apos;s knee .
&quot; If you had looked at it , sir , you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning .
I feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man &apos;s mouth . &quot;
He turned it over to expose the central page .
&quot; Here it is , and with your permission I will read it to you .
Listen to this , Mr. Holmes .
The headlines are : &apos; <unk> <unk> at Lower Norwood .
Disappearance of a <unk> <unk> .
Suspicion of Murder and <unk> .
A <unk> to the <unk> . &apos;
That is the clue which they are already following , Mr. Holmes , and I know that it leads <unk> to me .
I have been followed from London Bridge Station , and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me .
It will break my mother &apos;s <unk> will break her heart ! &quot;
He wrung his hands in an agony of <unk> , and <unk> backwards and forwards in his chair .
I looked with interest upon this man , who was <unk> of being the <unk> of a crime of violence .
He was flaxenhaired and handsome in a <unk> negative fashion , with frightened blue eyes and a cleanshaven face , with a weak , sensitive mouth .
His age may have been about <unk> ; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman .
From the pocket of his light summer overcoat <unk> the bundle of <unk> papers which <unk> his profession .
&quot; We must use what time we have , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Watson , would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in question ? &quot;
<unk> the vigorous headlines which our client had <unk> I read the following suggestive narrative : &quot; Late last night , or early this morning , an incident occurred at Lower Norwood which points , it is feared , to a serious crime .
Mr. Jonas Oldacre is a wellknown <unk> of that <unk> , where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years .
Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor , <unk> years of age , and lives in Deep Dene House , at the Sydenham end of the road of that name .
He has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits , secretive and <unk> .
For some years he has practically withdrawn from the business , in which he is said to have <unk> considerable wealth .
A small timberyard still <unk> , however , at the back of the house , and last night , about twelve o &apos;clock , an alarm was given that one of the <unk> was on fire .
The <unk> were soon upon the spot , but the dry wood burned with great fury , and it was impossible to arrest the <unk> until the <unk> had been entirely consumed .
Up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident , but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime .
<unk> was <unk> at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire , and an inquiry followed , which showed that he had disappeared from the house .
An examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in , that a safe which stood in it was open , that a number of important papers were scattered about the room , and , finally , that there were signs of a murderous struggle , slight traces of blood being found within the room , and an oaken <unk> , which also showed stains of blood upon the handle .
It is known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night , and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person , who is a young London solicitor named John Hector McFarlane , <unk> partner of <unk> and McFarlane , of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
The police believe that they have evidence in their possession which <unk> a very convincing motive for the crime , and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow .
&quot; <unk> is <unk> as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre .
It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued .
There have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at Norwood .
Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom ( which is on the ground floor ) were found to be open , that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the woodpile , and , finally , it is <unk> that charred remains have been found among the <unk> ashes of the fire .
The police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed , that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom , his papers rifled , and his dead body dragged across to the <unk> , which was then <unk> so as to hide all traces of the crime .
The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and <unk> . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and <unk> together to this remarkable account .
&quot; The case has certainly some points of interest , &quot; said he , in his <unk> fashion .
&quot; May I ask , in the first place , Mr. McFarlane , how it is that you are still at liberty , since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest ? &quot;
&quot; I live at <unk> Lodge , Blackheath , with my parents , Mr. Holmes ; but last night , having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre , I stayed at an hotel in Norwood , and came to my business from there .
I knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train , when I read what you have just heard .
I at once saw the horrible danger of my position , and I hurried to put the case into your hands .
I have no doubt that I should have been arrested either at my City office or at my home .
A man followed me from London Bridge Station , and I have no <unk> Heaven , what is that ? &quot;
It was a clang of the bell , followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair .
A moment later our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway .
Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside .
&quot; Mr. John Hector McFarlane ? &quot;
said Lestrade .
Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face .
&quot; I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre , of Lower Norwood . &quot;
McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair , and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed .
&quot; One moment , Lestrade , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Half an hour more or less can make no difference to you , and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair , which might aid us in clearing it up . &quot;
&quot; I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up , &quot; said Lestrade , <unk> .
&quot; None the less , with your permission , I should be much interested to hear his account . &quot;
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , it is difficult for me to refuse you anything , for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past , and we owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; At the same time I must remain with my prisoner , and I am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him . &quot;
&quot; I wish nothing better , &quot; said our client .
&quot; All I ask is that you should hear and recognise the absolute truth . &quot;
Lestrade looked at his watch .
&quot; I &apos;ll give you half an hour , &quot; said he .
&quot; I must explain first , &quot; said McFarlane , &quot; that I knew nothing of Mr. Jonas Oldacre .
His name was familiar to me , for many years ago my parents were <unk> with him , but they <unk> apart .
I was very much surprised , therefore , when yesterday , about three o &apos;clock in the afternoon , he walked into my office in the City .
But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit .
He had in his hand several sheets of a notebook , covered with scribbled <unk> they <unk> he laid them on my table .
&quot; &apos; Here is my will , &apos; said he .
&apos;I want you , Mr. McFarlane , to cast it into proper legal shape .
I will sit here while you do so . &apos;
&quot; I set myself to copy it , and you can imagine my astonishment when I found that , with some <unk> , he had left all his property to me .
He was a strange little , <unk> man , with white eyelashes , and when I looked up at him I found his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression .
I could hardly believe my own senses as I read the terms of the will ; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation , that he had known my parents in his youth , and that he had always heard of me as a very <unk> young man , and was assured that his money would be in worthy hands .
Of course , I could only <unk> out my thanks .
The will was duly finished , <unk> , and witnessed by my <unk> .
This is it on the blue paper , and these slips , as I have explained , are the rough draft .
Mr. Jonas Oldacre then informed me that there were a number of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , scrip , and so <unk> it was necessary that I should see and understand .
He said that his mind would not be easy until the whole thing was settled , and he begged me to come out to his house at Norwood that night , bringing the will with me , and to arrange matters .
<unk> , my boy , not one word to your parents about the affair until everything is settled .
We will keep it as a little surprise for them . &apos;
He was very <unk> upon this point , and made me promise it faithfully .
&quot; You can imagine , Mr. Holmes , that I was not in a humour to refuse him anything that he might ask .
He was my <unk> , and all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular .
I sent a telegram home , therefore , to say that I had important business on hand , and that it was impossible for me to say how late I might be .
Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine , as he might not be home before that hour .
I had some difficulty in finding his house , however , and it was nearly halfpast before I reached it .
I found him &quot; &quot; One moment ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Who opened the door ? &quot;
&quot; A middleaged woman , who was , I suppose , his housekeeper . &quot;
&quot; And it was she , I presume , who mentioned your name ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly , &quot; said McFarlane .
&quot; Pray proceed . &quot;
McFarlane <unk> his <unk> brow and then continued his narrative : &quot; I was shown by this woman into a sittingroom , where a frugal supper was laid out .
<unk> Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into his bedroom , in which there stood a heavy safe .
This he opened and took out a mass of documents , which we went over together .
It was between eleven and twelve when we finished .
He remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper .
He showed me out through his own French window , which had been open all this time . &quot;
&quot; Was the blind down ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; I will not be sure , but I believe that it was only half down .
Yes , I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window .
I could not find my stick , and he said , &apos; Never mind , my boy ; I shall see a good deal of you now , I hope , and I will keep your stick until you come back to claim it . &apos;
I left him there , the safe open , and the papers made up in packets upon the table .
It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath , so I spent the night at the <unk> <unk> , and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning . &quot;
&quot; Anything more that you would like to ask , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
said Lestrade , whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable explanation .
&quot; Not until I have been to Blackheath . &quot;
&quot; You mean to Norwood , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Oh , yes ; no doubt that is what I must have meant , &quot; said Holmes , with his <unk> smile .
Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that <unk> brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him .
I saw him look curiously at my companion .
&quot; I think I should like to have a word with you presently , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , &quot; said he .
&quot; Now , Mr. McFarlane , two of my constables are at the door and there is a fourwheeler waiting . &quot;
The wretched young man <unk> , and with a last <unk> glance at us walked from the room .
The officers conducted him to the cab , but Lestrade remained .
Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will , and was looking at them with the <unk> interest upon his face .
&quot; There are some points about that document , Lestrade , are there not ? &quot;
said he , pushing them over .
The official looked at them with a puzzled expression .
&quot; I can read the first few lines , and these in the middle of the second page , and one or two at the end .
Those are as clear as print , &quot; said he ; &quot; but the writing in between is very bad , and there are three places where I cannot read it at all . &quot;
&quot; What do you make of that ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Well , what do you make of it ? &quot;
&quot; That it was written in a train ; the good writing represents <unk> , the bad writing movement , and the very bad writing passing over points .
A scientific expert would <unk> at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line , since nowhere save in the immediate <unk> of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points .
<unk> that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will , then the train was an express , only <unk> once between Norwood and London Bridge . &quot;
Lestrade began to laugh .
&quot; You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said he .
&quot; How does this bear on the case ? &quot;
&quot; Well , it <unk> the young man &apos;s story to the extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday .
It is <unk> it not ? that a man should draw up so important a document in so <unk> a fashion .
It <unk> that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance .
If a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so . &quot;
&quot; Well , he drew up his own <unk> at the same time , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Oh , you think so ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Well , it is quite possible ; but the case is not clear to me yet . &quot;
&quot; Not clear ?
Well , if that isn &apos;t clear , what could be clear ?
Here is a young man who <unk> suddenly that if a certain older man dies he will succeed to a fortune .
What does he do ?
He says nothing to anyone , but he <unk> that he shall go out on some <unk> to see his client that night ; he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed , and then in the <unk> of a man &apos;s room he murders him , <unk> his body in the woodpile , and departs to a neighbouring hotel .
The bloodstains in the room and also on the stick are very slight .
It is probable that he imagined his crime to be a <unk> one , and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his <unk> which for some reason must have pointed to him .
Is all this not obvious ? &quot;
&quot; It strikes me , my good Lestrade , as being just a trifle too obvious , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; You do not add imagination to your other great qualities ; but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man , would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime ?
Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents ?
Again , would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house , when a servant has let you in ?
And , finally , would you take the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal ?
<unk> , Lestrade , that all this is very unlikely . &quot;
&quot; As to the stick , Mr. Holmes , you know as well as I do that a criminal is often <unk> and does things which a cool man would avoid .
He was very likely afraid to go back to the room .
Give me another theory that would fit the facts . &quot;
&quot; I could very easily give you halfadozen , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Here , for example , is a very possible and even probable one .
I make you a free present of it .
The older man is showing documents which are of evident value .
A passing tramp sees them through the window , the blind of which is only half down .
<unk> the solicitor .
<unk> the tramp !
He seizes a stick , which he observes there , kills Oldacre , and departs after burning the body . &quot;
&quot; Why should the tramp burn the body ? &quot;
&quot; For the matter of that why should McFarlane ? &quot;
&quot; To hide some evidence . &quot;
&quot; Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed . &quot;
&quot; And why did the tramp take nothing ? &quot;
&quot; Because they were papers that he could not <unk> . &quot;
Lestrade shook his head , though it seemed to me that his manner was less absolutely assured than before .
&quot; Well , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , you may look for your tramp , and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man .
The future will show which is right .
Just notice this point , Mr. Holmes : that so far as we know none of the papers were removed , and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for <unk> them , since he was <unk> and would come into them in any case . &quot;
My friend seemed struck by this remark .
&quot; I don &apos;t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory , &quot; said he .
&quot; I only wish to point out that there are other theories possible .
As you say , the future will decide .
Good morning !
I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and see how you are getting on . &quot;
When the detective departed my friend rose and made his preparations for the day &apos;s work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task before him .
&quot; My first movement , Watson , &quot; said he , as he bustled into his frockcoat , &quot; must , as I said , be in the direction of Blackheath . &quot;
&quot; And why not Norwood ? &quot;
&quot; Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident .
The police are making the mistake of <unk> their attention upon the second , because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal .
But it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first <unk> curious will , so suddenly made , and to so unexpected an heir .
It may do something to <unk> what followed .
No , my dear fellow , I don &apos;t think you can help me .
There is no <unk> of danger , or I should not dream of <unk> out without you .
I trust that when I see you in the evening I will be able to report that I have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster who has thrown himself upon my <unk> . &quot;
It was late when my friend returned , and I could see by a glance at his haggard and anxious face that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled .
For an hour he <unk> away upon his violin , endeavouring to <unk> his own ruffled spirits .
At last he flung down the instrument and plunged into a <unk> account of his <unk> .
&quot; It &apos;s all going wrong , <unk> as wrong as it can go .
I kept a bold face before Lestrade , but , upon my soul , I believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong .
All my <unk> are one way and all the facts are the other , and I much fear that British <unk> have not yet attained that <unk> of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade &apos;s facts . &quot;
&quot; Did you go to Blackheath ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Watson , I went there , and I found very quickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard .
The father was away in search of his son .
The mother was at <unk> little , fluffy , blueeyed person , in a <unk> of fear and indignation .
Of course , she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt .
But she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of Oldacre .
On the contrary , she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was <unk> considerably <unk> the case of the police , for , of course , if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion it would <unk> him towards hatred and violence .
&apos;He was more like a malignant and cunning ape than a human being , &apos; said she , &apos; and he always was , ever since he was a young man . &apos;
&quot; &apos; You knew him at that time ? &apos;
said I.
&quot; &apos; Yes , I knew him well ; in fact , he was an old <unk> of mine .
Thank Heaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better , if a <unk> , man .
I was engaged to him , Mr. Holmes , when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an <unk> , and I was so horrified at his brutal <unk> that I would have nothing more to do with him . &apos;
She rummaged in a bureau , and presently she produced a photograph of a woman , <unk> <unk> and mutilated with a knife .
<unk> is my own photograph , &apos; she said .
&apos;He sent it to me in that state , with his curse , upon my wedding morning . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Well , &apos; said I , &apos; at least he has <unk> you now , since he has left all his property to your son . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre , dead or alive , &apos; she cried , with a proper spirit .
<unk> is a God in Heaven , Mr. Holmes , and that same God who has punished that wicked man will show in His own good time that my son &apos;s hands are <unk> of his blood . &apos;
&quot; Well , I tried one or two leads , but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis , and several points which would make against it .
I gave it up at last and off I went to Norwood .
&quot; This place , Deep Dene House , is a big modern villa of staring brick , standing back in its own grounds , with a <unk> lawn in front of it .
To the right and some distance back from the road was the timberyard which had been the scene of the fire .
Here &apos;s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook .
This window on the left is the one which opens into Oldacre &apos;s room .
You can look into it from the road , you see .
That is about the only bit of consolation I have had today .
Lestrade was not there , but his head constable did the <unk> .
They had just made a great <unk> .
They had spent the morning <unk> among the ashes of the burned woodpile , and besides the charred <unk> remains they had secured several discoloured metal <unk> .
I examined them with care , and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons .
I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of &apos; <unk> , &apos; who was Oldacre &apos;s <unk> .
I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces , but this <unk> has made everything as hard as iron .
Nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through a low <unk> hedge which is in a line with the woodpile .
All that , of course , <unk> in with the official theory .
I crawled about the lawn with an August sun on my back , but I got up at the end of an hour no wiser than before .
&quot; Well , after this <unk> I went into the bedroom and examined that also .
The bloodstains were very slight , mere <unk> and <unk> , but undoubtedly fresh .
The stick had been removed , but there also the marks were slight .
There is no doubt about the stick <unk> to our client .
He <unk> it .
<unk> of both men could be made out on the carpet , but none of any third person , which again is a trick for the other side .
They were <unk> up their score all the time and we were at a <unk> .
&quot; Only one little gleam of hope did I <unk> yet it amounted to nothing .
I examined the contents of the safe , most of which had been taken out and left on the table .
The papers had been made up into sealed <unk> , one or two of which had been opened by the police .
They were not , so far as I could judge , of any great value , nor did the bankbook show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very <unk> circumstances .
But it seemed to me that all the papers were not there .
There were allusions to some <unk> the more <unk> I could not find .
This , of course , if we could definitely prove it , would turn Lestrade &apos;s argument against himself , for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it ?
&quot; Finally , having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent , I tried my luck with the housekeeper .
Mrs. Lexington is her name , a little , dark , silent person , with suspicious and <unk> eyes .
She could tell us something if she <unk> am convinced of it .
But she was as close as wax .
Yes , she had let Mr. McFarlane in at halfpast nine .
She wished her hand had <unk> before she had done so .
She had gone to bed at halfpast ten .
Her room was at the other end of the house , and she could hear nothing of what passed .
Mr. McFarlane had left his hat , and to the best of her belief his stick , in the hall .
She had been awakened by the alarm of fire .
Her poor , dear master had certainly been murdered .
Had he any enemies ?
Well , every man had enemies , but Mr. Oldacre kept himself very much to himself , and only met people in the way of business .
She had seen the buttons , and was sure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night .
The woodpile was very dry , for it had not <unk> for a month .
It burned like <unk> , and by the time she reached the spot nothing could be seen but <unk> .
She and all the <unk> <unk> the burned flesh from inside it .
She knew nothing of the papers , nor of Mr. Oldacre &apos;s private affairs .
&quot; So , my dear Watson , there &apos;s my report of a failure .
And yetand yet &quot; he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction &quot; I know it &apos;s all wrong .
I feel it in my <unk> .
There is something that has not come out , and that housekeeper knows it .
There was a sort of <unk> defiance in her eyes , which only goes with guilty knowledge .
However , there &apos;s no good talking any more about it , Watson ; but unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance <unk> will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which I foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure . &quot;
&quot; Surely , &quot; said I , &quot; the man &apos;s appearance would go far with any jury ? &quot;
&quot; That is a dangerous argument , my dear Watson .
You remember that terrible murderer , <unk> <unk> , who wanted us to get him off in &apos; <unk> ?
Was there ever a more <unk> , <unk> young man ? &quot;
&quot; It is true . &quot;
&quot; Unless we succeed in <unk> an alternative theory this man is lost .
You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him , and all further investigation has served to strengthen it .
By the way , there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the startingpoint for an inquiry .
On looking over the bankbook I found that the low state of the balance was <unk> due to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to Mr. Cornelius .
I confess that I should be interested to know who this Mr. Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large <unk> .
Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair ?
Cornelius might be a broker , but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large <unk> .
<unk> any other indication my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has <unk> these cheques .
But I fear , my dear fellow , that our case will end <unk> by Lestrade hanging our client , which will certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard . &quot;
I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night , but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and <unk> , his bright eyes the brighter for the dark <unk> round them .
The carpet round his chair was <unk> with <unk> and with the early editions of the morning papers .
An open telegram lay upon the table .
&quot; What do you think of this , Watson ? &quot;
he asked , <unk> it across .
It was from Norwood , and ran as follows : &quot; Important fresh evidence to hand .
McFarlane &apos;s guilt definitely established .
<unk> you to abandon case .
Lestrade .
&quot; This sounds serious , &quot; said I.
&quot; It is Lestrade &apos;s little <unk> of victory , &quot; Holmes answered , with a bitter smile .
&quot; And yet it may be premature to abandon the case .
After all , important fresh evidence is a <unk> thing , and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade imagines .
Take your breakfast , Watson , and we will go out together and see what we can do .
I feel as if I shall need your company and your <unk> support today . &quot;
My friend had no breakfast himself , for it was one of his <unk> that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food , and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from <unk> <unk> .
&quot; At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for <unk> , &quot; he would say in answer to my medical <unk> .
I was not surprised , therefore , when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him and started with me for Norwood .
A crowd of <unk> <unk> were still gathered round Deep Dene House , which was just such a suburban villa as I had <unk> .
Within the gates Lestrade met us , his face flushed with victory , his manner <unk> triumphant .
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , have you proved us to be wrong yet ?
Have you found your tramp ? &quot;
he cried .
&quot; I have formed no conclusion whatever , &quot; my companion answered .
&quot; But we formed ours yesterday , and now it proves to be correct ; so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred , &quot; said Holmes .
Lestrade laughed loudly .
&quot; You don &apos;t like being <unk> any more than the rest of us do , &quot; said he .
&quot; A man can &apos;t expect always to have it his own way , can he , Dr. Watson ?
<unk> this way , if you please , gentlemen , and I think I can convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime . &quot;
He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond .
&quot; This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done , &quot; said he .
&quot; Now , look at this . &quot;
With dramatic <unk> he struck a match and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the <unk> wall .
As he held the match nearer I saw that it was more than a stain .
It was the <unk> print of a thumb .
&quot; Look at that with your magnifying glass , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I am doing so . &quot;
&quot; You are aware that no two thumb marks are <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I have heard something of the kind . &quot;
&quot; Well , then , will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young McFarlane &apos;s right thumb , taken by my orders this morning ? &quot;
As he held the <unk> print close to the bloodstain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb .
It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost .
&quot; That is final , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Yes , that is final , &quot; I <unk> <unk> .
&quot; It is final , &quot; said Holmes .
Something in his tone caught my ear , and I turned to look at him .
An extraordinary change had come over his face .
It was writhing with inward merriment .
His two eyes were shining like stars .
It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to <unk> a convulsive attack of laughter .
&quot; Dear me !
Dear me ! &quot;
he said at last .
&quot; Well , now , who would have thought it ?
And how <unk> <unk> may be , to be sure !
Such a <unk> young man to look at !
It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment , is it not , Lestrade ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , some of us are a little too much inclined to be <unk> , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said Lestrade .
The man &apos;s <unk> was <unk> , but we could not <unk> it .
&quot; What a <unk> thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the <unk> !
Such a very natural action , too , if you come to think of it . &quot;
Holmes was <unk> calm , but his whole body gave a <unk> of suppressed excitement as he spoke .
&quot; By the way , Lestrade , who made this remarkable discovery ? &quot;
&quot; It was the housekeeper , Mrs. Lexington , who drew the night constable &apos;s attention to it . &quot;
&quot; Where was the night constable ? &quot;
&quot; He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed , so as to see that nothing was touched . &quot;
&quot; But why didn &apos;t the police see this mark yesterday ? &quot;
&quot; Well , we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall .
Besides , it &apos;s not in a very prominent place , as you see . &quot;
&quot; No , no , of course not .
I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday ? &quot;
Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind .
I confess that I was myself surprised both at his <unk> manner and at his rather wild observation .
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether you think that McFarlane came out of jail in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb . &quot;
&quot; It is <unk> the mark of his thumb . &quot;
&quot; There , that &apos;s enough , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; I am a practical man , Mr. Holmes , and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions .
If you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the sittingroom . &quot;
Holmes had recovered his <unk> , though I still seemed to <unk> <unk> of amusement in his expression .
&quot; Dear me , this is a very sad development , Watson , is it not ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client . &quot;
&quot; I am delighted to hear it , &quot; said I , heartily .
&quot; I was afraid it was all up with him . &quot;
&quot; I would hardly go so far as to say that , my dear Watson .
The fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend <unk> so much importance . &quot;
&quot; Indeed , Holmes !
What is it ? &quot;
&quot; Only this : that I know that that mark was not there when I examined the hall yesterday .
And now , Watson , let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine . &quot;
With a confused brain , but with a heart into which some <unk> of hope was returning , I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden .
Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it with great interest .
He then led the way inside and went over the whole building from <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> of the rooms were <unk> , but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely .
Finally , on the top corridor , which ran outside three <unk> bedrooms , he again was seized with a spasm of merriment .
&quot; There are really some very unique features about this case , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into our confidence .
He has had his little smile at our <unk> , and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be correct .
Yes , yes ; I think I see how we should approach it . &quot;
The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes interrupted him .
&quot; I understood that you were writing a report of this case , &quot; said he .
&quot; So I am . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you think it may be a little premature ?
I can &apos;t help thinking that your evidence is not complete . &quot;
Lestrade knew my friend too well to <unk> his words .
He laid down his pen and looked curiously at him .
&quot; What do you mean , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen . &quot;
&quot; Can you produce him ? &quot;
&quot; I think I can . &quot;
&quot; Then do so . &quot;
&quot; I will do my best .
How many constables have you ? &quot;
&quot; There are three within call . &quot;
&quot; Excellent ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; May I ask if they are all large , <unk> men with powerful voices ? &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt they are , though I fail to see what their voices have to do with it . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or two other things as well , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Kindly <unk> your men , and I will try . &quot;
Five minutes later three policemen had <unk> in the hall .
&quot; In the outhouse you will find a considerable <unk> of straw , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it .
I think it will be of the greatest assistance in <unk> the witness whom I require .
Thank you very much .
I believe you have some <unk> in your pocket , Watson .
Now , Mr. Lestrade , I will ask you all to accompany me to the top <unk> . &quot;
As I have said , there was a broad corridor there , which ran outside three empty bedrooms .
At one end of the corridor we were all <unk> by Sherlock Holmes , the constables grinning and Lestrade staring at my friend with amazement , expectation , and <unk> <unk> each other across his features .
Holmes stood before us with the air of a <unk> who is <unk> a trick .
&quot; Would you kindly send one of your constables for two <unk> of water ?
Put the straw on the floor here , free from the wall on either side .
Now I think that we are all ready . &quot;
Lestrade &apos;s face had begun to grow red and angry .
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether you are playing a game with us , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , &quot; said he .
&quot; If you know anything , you can surely say it without all this <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I assure you , my good Lestrade , that I have an excellent reason for everything that I do .
You may possibly remember that you <unk> me a little some hours ago , when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge , so you must not <unk> me a little <unk> and <unk> now .
Might I ask you , Watson , to open that window , and then to put a match to the edge of the straw ? &quot;
I did so , and , driven by the draught , a <unk> of grey smoke swirled down the corridor , while the dry straw crackled and <unk> .
&quot; Now we must see if we can find this witness for you , Lestrade .
Might I ask you all to join in the cry of &apos; Fire ! &apos; ?
Now , then ; one , two , three &quot; &quot; Fire ! &quot;
we all yelled .
&quot; Thank you .
I will trouble you once again . &quot;
&quot; Fire ! &quot;
&quot; Just once more , gentlemen , and all together . &quot;
&quot; Fire ! &quot;
The shout must have rung over Norwood .
It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened .
A door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor , and a little , wizened man darted out of it , like a <unk> out of its burrow .
&quot; Capital ! &quot;
said Holmes , <unk> .
&quot; Watson , a <unk> of water over the straw .
That will do !
Lestrade , allow me to present you with your principal missing witness , Mr. Jonas Oldacre . &quot;
The detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement .
The latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor , and peering at us and at the <unk> fire .
It was an odious <unk> , vicious , malignant , with <unk> , <unk> eyes and white eyelashes .
&quot; What &apos;s this , then ? &quot;
said Lestrade at last .
&quot; What have you been doing all this time , eh ? &quot;
Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh , shrinking back from the furious red face of the angry detective .
&quot; I have done no harm . &quot;
&quot; No harm ?
You have done your best to get an innocent man <unk> .
If it wasn &apos;t for this gentleman here , I am not sure that you would not have succeeded . &quot;
The wretched creature began to <unk> .
&quot; I am sure , sir , it was only my practical joke . &quot;
&quot; Oh !
a joke , was it ?
You won &apos;t find the laugh on your side , I promise you .
Take him down and keep him in the sittingroom until I come .
Mr. Holmes , &quot; he continued , when they had gone , &quot; I could not speak before the constables , but I don &apos;t mind saying , in the presence of Dr. Watson , that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet , though it is a mystery to me how you did it .
You have saved an innocent man &apos;s life , and you have prevented a very grave scandal , which would have ruined my reputation in the <unk> . &quot;
Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder .
&quot; <unk> of being ruined , my good sir , you will find that your reputation has been enormously <unk> .
Just make a few <unk> in that report which you were writing , and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade . &quot;
&quot; And you don &apos;t want your name to appear ? &quot;
&quot; Not at all .
The work is its own reward .
Perhaps I shall get the credit also at some distant day when I permit my <unk> <unk> to lay out his foolscap once <unk> , Watson ?
Well , now , let us see where this rat has been lurking . &quot;
A <unk> <unk> had been run across the passage six feet from the end , with a door <unk> concealed in it .
It was lit within by <unk> under the <unk> .
A few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within , together with a number of books and papers .
&quot; There &apos;s the advantage of being a builder , &quot; said Holmes , as we came out .
&quot; He was able to fix up his own little hidingplace without any <unk> , of course , that precious housekeeper of his , whom I should lose no time in <unk> to your bag , Lestrade . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll take your advice .
But how did you know of this place , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house .
When I paced one corridor and found it six feet <unk> than the corresponding one below , it was pretty clear where he was .
I thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire .
We could , of course , have gone in and taken him , but it amused me to make him <unk> himself ; besides , I <unk> you a little <unk> , Lestrade , for your <unk> in the morning . &quot;
&quot; Well , sir , you certainly got equal with me on that .
But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all ? &quot;
&quot; The thumbmark , Lestrade .
You said it was final ; and so it was , in a very different sense .
I knew it had not been there the day before .
I pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail , as you may have observed , and I had examined the hall and was sure that the wall was clear .
Therefore , it had been put on during the night . &quot;
&quot; But how ? &quot;
&quot; Very simply .
When those packets were sealed up , Jonas Oldacre got McFarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax .
It would be done so quickly and so naturally that I dare say the young man himself has no recollection of it .
Very likely it just so happened , and Oldacre had himself no <unk> of the use he would put it to .
<unk> over the case in that den of his , it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against McFarlane by using that thumbmark .
It was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal , to <unk> it in as much blood as he could get from a <unk> , and to put the mark upon the wall during the night , either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper .
If you examine among those documents which he took with him into his retreat I will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumbmark upon it . &quot;
&quot; Wonderful ! &quot;
said Lestrade .
&quot; Wonderful !
It &apos;s all as clear as <unk> , as you put it .
But what is the object of this deep deception , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
It was amusing to me to see how the detective &apos;s <unk> manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its <unk> .
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t think that is very hard to explain .
A very deep , <unk> , vindictive person is the gentleman who is now awaiting us downstairs .
You know that he was once refused by McFarlane &apos;s mother ?
You don &apos;t !
I told you that you should go to Blackheath first and Norwood afterwards .
Well , this injury , as he would consider it , has <unk> in his wicked , <unk> brain , and all his life he has longed for vengeance , but never seen his chance .
During the last year or two things have gone against <unk> speculation , I <unk> he finds himself in a bad way .
He <unk> to <unk> his creditors , and for this purpose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr. Cornelius , who is , I imagine , himself under another name .
I have not traced these cheques yet , but I have no doubt that they were <unk> under that name at some <unk> town where Oldacre from time to time led a double existence .
He intended to change his name altogether , draw this money , and <unk> , starting life again elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; Well , that &apos;s likely enough . &quot;
&quot; It would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track , and at the same time have an <unk> and crushing revenge upon his old <unk> , if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child .
It was a <unk> of villainy , and he carried it out like a master .
The idea of the will , which would give an obvious motive for the crime , the secret visit unknown to his own parents , the <unk> of the stick , the blood , and the animal remains and buttons in the woodpile , all were admirable .
It was a <unk> from which it seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape .
But he had not that supreme <unk> of the artist , the knowledge of when to stop .
He wished to <unk> that which was already <unk> draw the rope <unk> yet round the neck of his unfortunate <unk> so he ruined all .
Let us descend , Lestrade .
There are just one or two questions that I would ask him . &quot;
The malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a policeman upon each side of him .
&quot; It was a joke , my good sir , a practical joke , nothing more , &quot; he whined incessantly .
&quot; I assure you , sir , that I simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance , and I am sure that you would not be so <unk> as to imagine that I would have allowed any harm to befall poor young Mr.
McFarlane . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s for a jury to decide , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; Anyhow , we shall have you on a charge of <unk> , if not for attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; And you &apos;ll probably find that your creditors will <unk> the <unk> account of Mr. Cornelius , &quot; said Holmes .
The little man started and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend .
&quot; I have to thank you for a good deal , &quot; said he .
&quot; Perhaps I &apos;ll pay my <unk> some day . &quot;
Holmes smiled <unk> .
&quot; I fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully occupied , &quot; said he .
&quot; By the way , what was it you put into the woodpile besides your old trousers ?
A dead dog , or rabbits , or what ?
You won &apos;t tell ?
Dear me , how very <unk> of you !
Well , well , I dare say that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes .
If ever you write an account , Watson , you can make rabbits serve your turn . &quot;
Holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long , thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was <unk> a particularly <unk> <unk> .
His head was sunk upon his breast , and he looked from my point of view like a strange , lank bird , with dull grey <unk> and a black <unk> .
&quot; So , Watson , &quot; said he , suddenly , &quot; you do not propose to invest in South African securities ? &quot;
I gave a start of astonishment .
<unk> as I was to Holmes &apos;s curious <unk> , this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable .
&quot; How on earth do you know that ? &quot;
I asked .
He wheeled round upon his <unk> , with a <unk> testtube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deepset eyes .
&quot; Now , Watson , confess yourself utterly taken aback , &quot; said he .
&quot; I am . &quot;
&quot; I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect . &quot;
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind . &quot;
&quot; You see , my dear Watson &quot; he propped his testtube in the rack and began to <unk> with the air of a professor <unk> his class &quot; it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences , each <unk> upon its <unk> and each simple in itself .
If , after doing so , one simply <unk> out all the central inferences and presents one &apos;s audience with the startingpoint and the conclusion , one may produce a startling , though possibly a <unk> , effect .
Now , it was not really difficult , by an inspection of the <unk> between your left <unk> and thumb , to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I see no connection . &quot;
&quot; Very likely not ; but I can quickly show you a close connection .
Here are the missing links of the very simple chain : 1 .
You had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night .
2 .
You put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the <unk> .
3 .
You never play billiards except with Thurston .
<unk> .
You told me four weeks ago that Thurston had an <unk> on some South African property which would <unk> in a month , and which he desired you to share with him .
<unk> .
Your chequebook is locked in my drawer , and you have not asked for the key .
<unk> .
You do not propose to invest your money in this manner . &quot;
&quot; How absurdly simple ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; Quite so ! &quot;
said he , a little <unk> .
&quot; Every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you .
Here is an <unk> one .
See what you can make of that , friend Watson . &quot;
He tossed a sheet of paper upon the table and turned once more to his chemical analysis .
I looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper .
&quot; Why , Holmes , it is a child &apos;s drawing , &quot; I cried .
&quot; Oh , that &apos;s your idea ! &quot;
&quot; What else should it be ? &quot;
&quot; That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt , of Ridling Thorpe Manor , Norfolk , is very anxious to know .
This little <unk> came by the first post , and he was to follow by the next train .
There &apos;s a ring at the bell , Watson .
I should not be very much surprised if this were he . &quot;
A heavy step was heard upon the stairs , and an instant later there entered a tall , ruddy , cleanshaven gentleman , whose clear eyes and <unk> cheeks told of a life led far from the <unk> of Baker Street .
He seemed to bring a <unk> of his strong , fresh , bracing , <unk> air with him as he entered .
Having shaken hands with each of us , he was about to sit down when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings , which I had just examined and left upon the table .
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , what do you make of these ? &quot;
he cried .
&quot; They told me that you were fond of queer mysteries , and I don &apos;t think you can find a <unk> one than that .
I sent the paper on ahead so that you might have time to study it before I came . &quot;
&quot; It is certainly rather a curious production , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; At first sight it would appear to be some childish <unk> .
It consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn .
Why should you <unk> any importance to so grotesque an object ? &quot;
&quot; I never should , Mr. Holmes .
But my wife does .
It is <unk> her to death .
She says nothing , but I can see terror in her eyes .
That &apos;s why I want to <unk> the matter to the bottom . &quot;
Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it .
It was a page torn from a notebook .
The markings were done in pencil , and ran in this way : Picture : Picture of several figures of dancing men , some holding flags Holmes examined it for some time , and then , <unk> it carefully up , he placed it in his pocketbook .
&quot; This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case , &quot; said he .
&quot; You gave me a few particulars in your letter , Mr. Hilton Cubitt , but I should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend , Dr.
Watson . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not much of a <unk> , &quot; said our visitor , nervously <unk> and <unk> his great , strong hands .
&quot; You &apos;ll just ask me anything that I don &apos;t make clear .
I &apos;ll begin at the time of my marriage last year ; but I want to say first of all that , though I &apos;m not a rich man , my people have been at Ridling Thorpe for a matter of five <unk> , and there is no better known family in the County of Norfolk .
Last year I came up to London for the <unk> , and I stopped at a <unk> in <unk> Square , because Parker , the vicar of our <unk> , was staying in it .
There was an American young lady <unk> was the <unk> Patrick .
In some way we became friends , until before my month was up I was as much in love as a man could be .
We were quietly married at a <unk> office , and we returned to Norfolk a <unk> couple .
You &apos;ll think it very mad , Mr. Holmes , that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion , knowing nothing of her past or of her people ; but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand .
&quot; She was very straight about it , was Elsie .
I can &apos;t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so .
&apos;I have had some very <unk> associations in my life , &apos; said she ; &apos; I wish to forget all about them .
I would rather never allude to the past , for it is very painful to me .
If you take me , Hilton , you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of ; but you will have to be content with my word for it , and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours .
If these conditions are too hard , then go back to Norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me . &apos;
It was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me .
I told her that I was content to take her on her own terms , and I have been as good as my word .
&quot; Well , we have been married now for a year , and very happy we have been .
But about a month ago , at the end of June , I saw for the first time signs of trouble .
One day my wife received a letter from America .
I saw the American <unk> .
She turned deadly white , read the letter , and threw it into the fire .
She made no allusion to it afterwards , and I made none , for a promise is a promise ; but she has never known an easy hour from that moment .
There is always a look of fear upon her facea look as if she were waiting and expecting .
She would do better to trust me .
She would find that I was her best friend .
But until she speaks I can say nothing .
<unk> you , she is a <unk> woman , Mr. Holmes , and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers .
I am only a simple Norfolk squire , but there is not a man in England who <unk> his family honour more highly than I do .
She knows it well , and she knew it well before she married me .
She would never bring any stain upon <unk> that I am sure .
&quot; Well , now I come to the queer part of my story .
About a week <unk> was the Tuesday of last <unk> found on one of the <unk> a number of absurd little dancing figures , like these upon the paper .
They were scrawled with chalk .
I thought that it was the stableboy who had drawn them , but the lad swore he knew nothing about it .
Anyhow , they had come there during the night .
I had them <unk> out , and I only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards .
To my surprise she took it very seriously , and begged me if any more came to let her see them .
None did come for a week , and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on the sundial in the garden .
I showed it to Elsie , and down she dropped in a dead faint .
Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream , half dazed , and with terror always lurking in her eyes .
It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you , Mr. Holmes .
It was not a thing that I could take to the police , for they would have laughed at me , but you will tell me what to do .
