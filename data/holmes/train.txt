he asked , at last .
&quot; He is in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , at <unk> . &quot;
&quot; He would not pay you a surprise visit ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , Mr. Holmes !
As if I should not know him ! &quot;
&quot; Have you had any other <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Several before I knew Cyril . &quot;
&quot; And since ? &quot;
&quot; There was this dreadful man , Woodley , if you can call him an admirer . &quot;
&quot; No one else ? &quot;
Our fair client seemed a little confused .
&quot; Who was he ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; Oh , it may be a mere fancy of mine ; but it has seemed to me sometimes that my employer , Mr. Carruthers , takes a great deal of interest in me .
We are thrown rather together .
I play his <unk> in the evening .
He has never said anything .
He is a perfect gentleman .
But a girl always knows . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
Holmes looked grave .
&quot; What does he do for a living ? &quot;
&quot; He is a rich man . &quot;
&quot; No carriages or horses ? &quot;
&quot; Well , at least he is fairly <unk> .
But he goes into the City two or three times a week .
He is deeply interested in South African gold shares . &quot;
&quot; You will let me know any fresh development , Miss Smith .
I am very busy just now , but I will find time to make some inquiries into your case .
In the meantime take no step without letting me know .
Goodbye , and I trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you . &quot;
&quot; It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should have <unk> , &quot; said Holmes , as he pulled at his <unk> pipe , &quot; but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads .
Some secretive <unk> , beyond all doubt .
But there are curious and suggestive details about the case , Watson . &quot;
&quot; That he should appear only at that point ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
Our first effort must be to find who are the <unk> of Charlington Hall .
Then , again , how about the connection between Carruthers and Woodley , since they appear to be men of such a different <unk> ?
How came they both to be so keen upon looking up Ralph Smith &apos;s relations ?
One more point .
What sort of a <unk> is it which pays double the market price for a <unk> , but does not keep a horse although six miles from the station ?
<unk> , <unk> odd ! &quot;
&quot; You will go down ? &quot;
&quot; No , my dear fellow , you will go down .
This may be some trifling intrigue , and I cannot break my other important research for the sake of it .
On Monday you will arrive early at Farnham ; you will conceal yourself near Charlington Heath ; you will observe these facts for yourself , and act as your own judgment <unk> .
Then , having inquired as to the occupants of the Hall , you will come back to me and report .
And now , Watson , not another word of the matter until we have a few solid <unk> on which we may hope to get across to our solution . &quot;
We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at <unk> , so I started early and caught the <unk> .
At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in being directed to Charlington Heath .
It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady &apos;s adventure , for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other , surrounding a park which is <unk> with magnificent trees .
There was a main gateway of <unk> stone , each side <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> ; but besides this central carriage drive I observed several points where there were <unk> in the hedge and paths leading through them .
The house was invisible from the road , but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and <unk> .
The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse , gleaming <unk> in the light of the bright spring sunshine .
<unk> one of these clumps I took up my position , so as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side .
It had been deserted when I left it , but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which I had come .
He was clad in a dark suit , and I saw that he had a black beard .
On <unk> the end of the Charlington grounds he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge , disappearing from my view .
A quarter of an hour passed and then a second cyclist appeared .
This time it was the young lady coming from the station .
I saw her look about her as she came to the Charlington hedge .
An instant later the man emerged from his hidingplace , sprang upon his cycle , and followed her .
In all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures , the graceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine , and the man behind her bending low over his handlebar , with a curiously furtive suggestion in every movement .
She looked back at him and slowed her pace .
He slowed also .
She stopped .
He at once stopped too , keeping two hundred yards behind her .
Her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited .
She suddenly <unk> her wheels round and dashed straight at him !
He was as quick as she , however , and darted off in desperate flight .
<unk> she came back up the road again , her head <unk> in the air , not <unk> to take any further notice of her silent <unk> .
He had turned also , and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my sight .
I remained in my hidingplace , and it was well that I did so , for presently the man reappeared <unk> slowly back .
He turned in at the Hall gates and <unk> from his machine .
For some few minutes I could see him standing among the trees .
His hands were raised and he seemed to be <unk> his necktie .
Then he mounted his cycle and rode away from me down the drive towards the Hall .
I ran across the heath and peered through the trees .
Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey building with its bristling <unk> <unk> , but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery , and I saw no more of my man .
However , it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good morning &apos;s work , and I walked back in high spirits to Farnham .
The local houseagent could tell me nothing about Charlington Hall , and referred me to a wellknown firm in Pall Mall .
There I halted on my way home , and met with courtesy from the <unk> .
No , I could not have Charlington Hall for the summer .
I was just too late .
It had been let about a month ago .
Mr. Williamson was the name of the tenant .
He was a respectable elderly gentleman .
The polite agent was afraid he could say no more , as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss .
Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which I was able to present to him that evening , but it did not <unk> that word of <unk> praise which I had hoped for and should have <unk> .
On the contrary , his austere face was even more severe than usual as he <unk> upon the things that I had done and the things that I had not .
&quot; Your hidingplace , my dear Watson , was very <unk> .
You should have been behind the hedge ; then you would have had a close view of this interesting person .
As it is you were some hundreds of yards away , and can tell me even less than Miss Smith .
She thinks she does not know the man ; I am convinced she does .
Why , otherwise , should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features ?
You describe him as bending over the handlebar .
<unk> again , you see .
You really have done remarkably badly .
He <unk> to the house and you want to find out who he is .
You come to a London houseagent ! &quot;
&quot; What should I have done ? &quot;
I cried , with some heat .
&quot; <unk> to the nearest publichouse .
That is the centre of country gossip .
They would have told you every name , from the master to the <unk> .
Williamson !
It <unk> nothing to my mind .
If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who <unk> away from that athletic young lady &apos;s pursuit .
What have we gained by your expedition ?
The knowledge that the girl &apos;s story is true .
I never doubted it .
That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall .
I never doubted that either .
That the Hall is <unk> by Williamson .
Who &apos;s the better for that ?
Well , well , my dear sir , don &apos;t look so depressed .
We can do little more until next Saturday , and in the meantime I may make one or two inquiries myself . &quot;
Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith , <unk> shortly and <unk> the very incidents which I had seen , but the pith of the letter lay in the <unk> : &quot; I am sure that you will respect my confidence , Mr. Holmes , when I tell you that my place here has become difficult <unk> to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me .
I am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable .
At the same time my promise is , of course , given .
He took my refusal very seriously , but also very gently .
You can understand , however , that the situation is a little strained . &quot;
&quot; Our young friend seems to be getting into deep <unk> , &quot; said Holmes , thoughtfully , as he finished the letter .
&quot; The case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had <unk> thought .
I should be none the worse for a quiet , peaceful day in the country , and I am inclined to run down this afternoon and <unk> one or two theories which I have formed . &quot;
Holmes &apos;s quiet day in the country had a singular termination , for he arrived at Baker Street late in the evening with a cut <unk> and a discoloured <unk> upon his forehead , besides a general air of <unk> which would have made his own person the <unk> object of a Scotland Yard investigation .
He was immensely <unk> by his own adventures , and laughed heartily as he <unk> them .
&quot; I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat , &quot; said he .
&quot; You are aware that I have some <unk> in the good old British sport of <unk> .
<unk> it is of service .
Today , for example , I should have come to very <unk> grief without it . &quot;
I begged him to tell me what had occurred .
&quot; I found that country <unk> which I had already <unk> to your notice , and there I made my discreet inquiries .
I was in the bar , and a <unk> landlord was giving me all that I wanted .
Williamson is a <unk> man , and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the Hall .
There is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman ; but one or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly <unk> .
I have already made some inquiries at a <unk> <unk> , and they tell me that there was a man of that name in orders whose career has been a singularly dark one .
The landlord further informed me that there are usually weekend visitors &apos;a warm <unk> , sir <unk> the Hall , and especially one gentleman with a red moustache , Mr. Woodley by name , who was always there .
We had got as far as this when who should walk in but the gentleman himself , who had been drinking his <unk> in the <unk> and had heard the whole conversation .
Who was I ?
What did I want ?
What did I mean by asking questions ?
He had a fine <unk> of language , and his <unk> were very vigorous .
He ended a string of <unk> by a vicious <unk> which I failed to entirely avoid .
The next few minutes were <unk> .
It was a straight left against a <unk> ruffian .
I emerged as you see me .
Mr. Woodley went home in a cart .
So ended my country <unk> , and it must be confessed that , however <unk> , my day on the Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own . &quot;
The Thursday brought us another letter from our client .
You will not be surprised , Mr. Holmes said she to hear that I am leaving Mr. Carruthers &apos;s employment .
Even the high pay cannot reconcile me to the <unk> of my situation .
On Saturday I come up to town and I do not intend to return .
Mr. Carruthers has got a trap , and so the dangers of the lonely road , if there ever were any dangers , are now over .
As to the special cause of my leaving , it is not merely the strained situation with Mr. Carruthers , but it is the reappearance of that odious man , Mr. Woodley .
He was always hideous , but he looks more awful than ever now , for he appears to have had an accident and he is much <unk> .
I saw him out of the window , but I am glad to say I did not meet him .
He had a long talk with Mr. Carruthers , who seemed much excited afterwards .
Woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood , for he did not sleep here , and yet I caught a glimpse of him again this morning slinking about in the shrubbery .
I would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place .
I <unk> and fear him more than I can say .
How can Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature for a moment ?
However , all my <unk> will be over on Saturday .
&quot; So I trust , Watson ; so I trust , &quot; said Holmes , gravely .
&quot; There is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman , and it is our duty to see that no one <unk> her upon that last journey .
I think , Watson , that we must spare time to run down together on Saturday morning , and make sure that this curious and <unk> investigation has no <unk> ending . &quot;
I confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of the case , which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous .
That a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome woman is no <unk> thing , and if he had so little audacity that he not only dared not address her , but even fled from her approach , he was not a very formidable <unk> .
The ruffian Woodley was a very different person , but , except on one occasion , he had not molested our client , and now he visited the house of Carruthers without intruding upon her presence .
The man on the bicycle was <unk> a member of those weekend parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken ; but who he was or what he wanted was as obscure as ever .
It was the <unk> of Holmes &apos;s manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to <unk> behind this curious train of events .
A <unk> night had been followed by a <unk> morning , and the <unk> countryside with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of London .
Holmes and I walked along the broad , <unk> road <unk> the fresh morning air , and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring .
From a rise of the road on the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the grim Hall bristling out from <unk> the ancient <unk> , which , old as they were , were still younger than the building which they surrounded .
Holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound , a <unk> yellow <unk> , between the brown of the heath and the <unk> green of the woods .
Far away , a black dot , we could see a vehicle moving in our direction .
Holmes gave an exclamation of impatience .
&quot; I had given a margin of half an hour , &quot; said he .
&quot; If that is her trap she must be making for the earlier train .
I fear , Watson , that she will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her . &quot;
From the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see the vehicle , but we hastened onwards at such a pace that my <unk> life began to tell upon me , and I was compelled to fall behind .
Holmes , however , was always in training , for he had <unk> <unk> of nervous energy upon which to draw .
His springy step never slowed until suddenly , when he was a hundred yards in front of me , he halted , and I saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair .
At the same instant an empty dogcart , the horse <unk> , the reins <unk> , appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us .
&quot; Too late , Watson ; too late ! &quot;
cried Holmes , as I ran panting to his side .
&quot; <unk> that I was not to allow for that earlier train !
It &apos;s abduction , <unk> !
Murder !
Heaven knows what !
<unk> the road !
Stop the horse !
That &apos;s right .
Now , jump in , and let us see if I can <unk> the consequences of my own blunder . &quot;
We had sprung into the dogcart , and Holmes , after turning the horse , gave it a sharp cut with the whip , and we flew back along the road .
As we turned the curve the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the heath was opened up .
I grasped Holmes &apos;s arm .
&quot; That &apos;s the man ! &quot;
I gasped .
A solitary cyclist was coming towards us .
His head was down and his shoulders rounded as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to the <unk> .
He was flying like a <unk> .
Suddenly he raised his bearded face , saw us close to him , and pulled up , springing from his machine .
That <unk> beard was in singular contrast to the pallor of his face , and his eyes were as bright as if he had a fever .
He stared at us and at the dogcart .
Then a look of amazement came over his face .
&quot; Halloa !
Stop there ! &quot;
he shouted , holding his bicycle to block our road .
&quot; Where did you get that dogcart ?
Pull up , man ! &quot;
he yelled , drawing a pistol from his side pocket .
&quot; Pull up , I say , or , by George , I &apos;ll put a bullet into your horse . &quot;
Holmes threw the reins into my <unk> and sprang down from the cart .
&quot; You &apos;re the man we want to see .
Where is Miss Violet Smith ? &quot;
he said , in his quick , clear way .
&quot; That &apos;s what I am asking you .
You &apos;re in her dogcart .
You ought to know where she is . &quot;
&quot; We met the dogcart on the road .
There was no one in it .
We drove back to help the young lady . &quot;
&quot; Good Lord !
Good Lord !
what shall I do ? &quot;
cried the stranger , in an ecstasy of despair .
&quot; They &apos;ve got her , that <unk> Woodley and the blackguard parson .
Come , man , come , if you really are her friend .
Stand by me and we &apos;ll save her , if I have to leave my <unk> in Charlington <unk> . &quot;
He ran <unk> , his pistol in his hand , towards a gap in the hedge .
Holmes followed him , and I , leaving the horse <unk> beside the road , followed Holmes .
&quot; This is where they came through , &quot; said he , pointing to the marks of several feet upon the muddy path .
&quot; Halloa !
Stop a minute !
Who &apos;s this in the <unk> ? &quot;
It was a young fellow about seventeen , dressed like an ostler , with leather <unk> and <unk> .
He lay upon his back , his knees drawn up , a terrible cut upon his head .
He was insensible , but alive .
A glance at his wound told me that it had not <unk> the bone .
&quot; That &apos;s Peter , the groom , &quot; cried the stranger .
&quot; He drove her .
The <unk> have pulled him off and clubbed him .
Let him lie ; we can &apos;t do him any good , but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman . &quot;
We ran <unk> down the path , which wound among the trees .
We had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when Holmes pulled up .
&quot; They didn &apos;t go to the house .
Here are their marks on the <unk> , beside the <unk> bushes !
Ah , I said so ! &quot;
As he spoke a woman &apos;s shrill <unk> scream which vibrated with a frenzy of <unk> from the thick green <unk> of bushes in front of us .
It ended suddenly on its highest note with a <unk> and a <unk> .
&quot; This way !
This way !
They are in the <unk> <unk> , &quot; cried the stranger , darting through the bushes .
&quot; Ah , the <unk> dogs !
<unk> me , gentlemen !
Too late !
too late !
by the living <unk> ! &quot;
We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of <unk> surrounded by ancient trees .
On the farther side of it , under the shadow of a <unk> oak , there stood a singular group of three people .
One was a woman , our client , drooping and faint , a handkerchief round her mouth .
Opposite her stood a brutal , <unk> , redmoustached young man , his <unk> legs parted wide , one arm <unk> , the other <unk> a ridingcrop , his whole attitude suggestive of triumphant <unk> .
Between them an elderly , <unk> man , wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit , had evidently just completed the wedding service , for he <unk> his <unk> as we appeared and <unk> the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial <unk> .
&quot; They &apos;re married ! &quot;
I gasped .
&quot; Come on ! &quot;
cried our guide ; &quot; come on ! &quot;
He rushed across the glade , Holmes and I at his heels .
As we approached , the lady staggered against the <unk> of the tree for support .
Williamson , the <unk> , bowed to us with <unk> <unk> , and the bully Woodley advanced with a shout of brutal and <unk> laughter .
&quot; You can take your beard off , Bob , &quot; said he .
&quot; I know you right enough .
Well , you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to Mrs.
Woodley . &quot;
Our guide &apos;s answer was a singular one .
He snatched off the dark beard which had <unk> him and threw it on the ground , <unk> a long , sallow , cleanshaven face below it .
Then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian , who was <unk> upon him with his dangerous ridingcrop swinging in his hand .
&quot; Yes , &quot; said our <unk> , &quot; I am Bob Carruthers , and I &apos;ll see this woman <unk> if I have to swing for it .
I told you what I &apos;d do if you molested her , and , by the Lord , I &apos;ll be as good as my word ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re too late .
She &apos;s my wife ! &quot;
&quot; No , she &apos;s your widow . &quot;
His revolver <unk> , and I saw the blood spurt from the front of Woodley &apos;s waistcoat .
He <unk> round with a scream and fell upon his back , his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor .
The old man , still clad in his surplice , burst into such a string of foul <unk> as I have never heard , and pulled out a revolver of his own , but before he could raise it he was looking down the barrel of Holmes &apos;s weapon .
&quot; <unk> of this , &quot; said my friend , coldly .
&quot; <unk> that pistol !
Watson , pick it up !
Hold it to his head !
Thank you .
You , Carruthers , give me that revolver .
We &apos;ll have no more violence .
Come , hand it over ! &quot;
&quot; Who are you , then ? &quot;
&quot; My name is Sherlock Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Good Lord ! &quot;
&quot; You have heard of me , I see .
I will represent the official police until their arrival .
Here , you ! &quot;
he shouted to a frightened groom who had appeared at the edge of the glade .
&quot; Come here .
Take this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham . &quot;
He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook .
&quot; Give it to the <unk> at the policestation .
Until he comes I must <unk> you all under my personal custody . &quot;
The strong , masterful personality of Holmes <unk> the tragic scene , and all were equally <unk> in his hands .
Williamson and Carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house , and I gave my arm to the frightened girl .
The injured man was laid on his bed , and at Holmes &apos;s request I examined him .
I carried my report to where he sat in the old <unk> diningroom with his two <unk> before him .
&quot; He will live , &quot; said I.
&quot; What ! &quot;
cried Carruthers , springing out of his chair .
&quot; I &apos;ll go upstairs and finish him first .
Do you tell me that that girl , that <unk> , is to be tied to <unk> Jack Woodley for life ? &quot;
&quot; You need not <unk> yourself about that , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; There are two very good reasons why she should under no circumstances be his wife .
In the first place , we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson &apos;s right to <unk> a marriage . &quot;
&quot; I have been <unk> , &quot; cried the old rascal .
&quot; And also <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Once a clergyman , always a clergyman . &quot;
&quot; I think not .
How about the license ? &quot;
&quot; We had a license for the marriage .
I have it here in my pocket . &quot;
&quot; Then you got it by a trick .
But in any case a forced marriage is no marriage , but it is a very serious felony , as you will discover before you have finished .
You &apos;ll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so , unless I am mistaken .
As to you , Carruthers , you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket . &quot;
&quot; I begin to think so , Mr. Holmes ; but when I thought of all the precaution I had taken to shield this <unk> I loved her , Mr. Holmes , and it is the only time that ever I knew what love <unk> fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in South Africa , a man whose name is a <unk> terror from <unk> to Johannesburg .
Why , Mr. Holmes , you &apos;ll hardly believe it , but ever since that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past this house , where I knew these rascals were lurking , without following her on my bicycle just to see that she came to no harm .
I kept my distance from her , and I wore a beard so that she should not recognise me , for she is a good and highspirited girl , and she wouldn &apos;t have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that I was following her about the country roads . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell her of her danger ? &quot;
&quot; Because then , again , she would have left me , and I couldn &apos;t bear to face that .
Even if she couldn &apos;t love me it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house , and to hear the sound of her voice . &quot;
&quot; Well , &quot; said I , &quot; you call that love , Mr. Carruthers , but I should call it <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Maybe the two things go together .
Anyhow , I couldn &apos;t let her go .
Besides , with this crowd about , it was well that she should have someone near to look after her .
Then when the cable came I knew they were bound to make a move . &quot;
&quot; What cable ? &quot;
Carruthers took a telegram from his pocket .
&quot; That &apos;s it , &quot; said he .
It was short and <unk> : The old man is dead .
&quot; Hum ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; I think I see how things worked , and I can understand how this message would , as you say , bring them to a head .
But while we wait you might tell me what you can . &quot;
The old <unk> with the surplice burst into a <unk> of bad language .
&quot; By Heaven , &quot; said he , &quot; if you <unk> on us , Bob Carruthers , I &apos;ll serve you as you served Jack Woodley .
You can <unk> about the girl to your heart &apos;s content , for that &apos;s your own affair , but if you round on your pals to this plainclothes copper it will be the worst day &apos;s work that ever you did . &quot;
&quot; Your reverence need not be excited , &quot; said Holmes , lighting a cigarette .
&quot; The case is clear enough against you , and all I ask is a few details for my private curiosity .
However , if there &apos;s any difficulty in your telling me I &apos;ll do the talking , and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets .
In the first place , three of you came from South Africa on this <unk> Williamson , you Carruthers , and Woodley . &quot;
&quot; <unk> number one , &quot; said the old man ; &quot; I never saw either of them until two months ago , and I have never been in Africa in my life , so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it , Mr. <unk> Holmes ! &quot;
&quot; What he says is true , &quot; said Carruthers .
&quot; Well , well , two of you came over .
His reverence is our own <unk> article .
You had known Ralph Smith in South Africa .
You had reason to believe he would not live long .
You found out that his <unk> would inherit his fortune .
How &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
Carruthers nodded and Williamson swore .
&quot; She was <unk> , no doubt , and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will . &quot;
&quot; <unk> &apos;t read or write , &quot; said Carruthers .
&quot; So you came over , the two of you , and hunted up the girl .
The idea was that one of you was to marry her and the other have a share of the plunder .
For some reason Woodley was chosen as the husband .
Why was that ? &quot;
&quot; We played cards for her on the voyage .
He won . &quot;
&quot; I see .
You got the young lady into your service , and there Woodley was to do the <unk> .
She recognised the drunken brute that he was , and would have nothing to do with him .
Meanwhile , your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady .
You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian <unk> her . &quot;
&quot; No , by George , I couldn &apos;t ! &quot;
&quot; There was a quarrel between you .
He left you in a rage , and began to make his own plans independently of you . &quot;
&quot; It strikes me , Williamson , there isn &apos;t very much that we can tell this gentleman , &quot; cried Carruthers , with a bitter laugh .
&quot; Yes , we <unk> , and he knocked me down .
I am level with him on that , anyhow .
Then I lost sight of him .
That was when he picked up with this cast <unk> here .
I found that they had set up <unk> together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station .
I kept my eye on her after that , for I knew there was some <unk> in the wind .
I saw them from time to time , for I was anxious to know what they were after .
Two days ago Woodley came up to my house with this cable , which showed that Ralph Smith was dead .
He asked me if I would stand by the bargain .
I said I would not .
He asked me if I would marry the girl myself and give him a share .
I said I would willingly do so , but that she would not have me .
He said , &apos; Let us get her married first , and after a week or two she may see things a bit different . &apos;
I said I would have nothing to do with violence .
So he went off cursing , like the foulmouthed blackguard that he was , and <unk> that he would have her yet .
She was leaving me this weekend , and I had got a trap to take her to the station , but I was so uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my bicycle .
She had got a start , however , and before I could catch her the mischief was done .
The first thing I knew about it was when I saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dogcart . &quot;
Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate .
&quot; I have been very <unk> , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; When in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery , that alone should have told me all .
However , we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in some respects a unique case .
I perceive three of the county <unk> in the drive , and I am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them ; so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be <unk> <unk> by their morning &apos;s adventures .
I think , Watson , that in your medical <unk> you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to escort her to her mother &apos;s home .
If she is not quite <unk> you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young <unk> in the <unk> would probably complete the <unk> .
As to you , Mr. Carruthers , I think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot .
There is my card , sir , and if my evidence can be of help to you in your trial it shall be at your disposal . &quot;
In the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> it has often been difficult for me , as the reader has probably observed , to round off my narratives , and to give those final details which the curious might expect .
Each case has been the prelude to another , and the crisis once over the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives .
I find , however , a short note at the end of my <unk> dealing with this case , in which I have put it upon record that Miss Violet Smith did indeed inherit a large fortune , and that she is now the wife of Cyril Morton , the <unk> partner of Morton &amp; <unk> , the famous Westminster <unk> .
Williamson and Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault , the former getting seven years and the latter ten .
Of the fate of Carruthers I have no record , but I am sure that his assault was not <unk> very gravely by the Court , since Woodley had the reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian , and I think that a few months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice .
We have had some dramatic <unk> and exits upon our small stage at Baker Street , but I cannot <unk> anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of Thorneycroft Huxtable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
His card , which seemed too small to carry the weight of his <unk> <unk> , preceded him by a few seconds , and then he entered <unk> large , so pompous , and so <unk> that he was the very <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
And yet his first action when the door had closed behind him was to <unk> against the table , whence he slipped down upon the floor , and there was that <unk> figure <unk> and insensible upon our <unk> hearthrug .
We had sprung to our feet , and for a few moments we stared in silent amazement at this <unk> piece of <unk> , which told of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the <unk> of life .
Then Holmes hurried with a cushion for his head and I with brandy for his lips .
The heavy white face was <unk> with lines of trouble , the hanging <unk> under the closed eyes were <unk> in colour , the loose mouth <unk> <unk> at the corners , the rolling <unk> were unshaven .
<unk> and shirt bore the grime of a long journey , and the hair bristled unkempt from the <unk> head .
It was a <unk> man who lay before us .
&quot; What is it , Watson ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; <unk> <unk> mere hunger and fatigue , &quot; said I , with my finger on the <unk> <unk> , where the stream of life trickled thin and small .
&quot; <unk> <unk> from Mackleton , in the North of England , &quot; said Holmes , drawing it from the <unk> .
&quot; It is not twelve o &apos;clock yet .
He has certainly been an early <unk> . &quot;
The puckered eyelids had begun to <unk> , and now a pair of vacant , grey eyes looked up at us .
An instant later the man had scrambled on to his feet , his face crimson with shame .
&quot; <unk> this weakness , Mr. Holmes ; I have been a little <unk> .
Thank you , if I might have a glass of milk and a <unk> I have no doubt that I should be better .
I came personally , Mr. Holmes , in order to ensure that you would return with me .
I feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute <unk> of the case . &quot;
&quot; When you are quite <unk> &quot; I am quite well again .
I cannot imagine how I came to be so weak .
I wish you , Mr. Holmes , to come to Mackleton with me by the next train . &quot;
My friend shook his head .
&quot; My colleague , Dr. Watson , could tell you that we are very busy at present .
I am <unk> in this case of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> murder is coming up for trial .
Only a very important issue could call me from London at present . &quot;
&quot; Important ! &quot;
Our visitor threw up his hands .
&quot; Have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the Duke of Holdernesse ? &quot;
&quot; What !
the late Cabinet Minister ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
We had tried to keep it out of the papers , but there was some rumour in the <unk> last night .
I thought it might have reached your ears . &quot;
Holmes shot out his long , thin arm and picked out <unk> &quot; H &quot; in his <unk> of reference .
&quot; &apos; Holdernesse , <unk> Duke , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> the alphabet !
<unk> <unk> , Earl of Carston <unk> me , what a list !
<unk> <unk> of Hallamshire since <unk> .
<unk> Edith , daughter of Sir Charles Appledore , <unk> .
<unk> and only child , Lord Saltire .
<unk> about two hundred and fifty thousand <unk> .
<unk> in <unk> and Wales .
Address : <unk> House Terrace ; Holdernesse Hall , Hallamshire ; Carston <unk> , <unk> , Wales .
Lord of the <unk> , <unk> ; <unk> Secretary of State for &apos; Well , well , this man is certainly one of the greatest <unk> of the <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; The greatest and perhaps the <unk> .
I am aware , Mr. Holmes , that you take a very high line in professional matters , and that you are prepared to work for the work &apos;s sake .
I may tell you , however , that his Grace has already <unk> that a cheque for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is , and another thousand to him who can name the man , or men , who have taken him . &quot;
&quot; It is a <unk> offer , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Watson , I think that we shall accompany Dr. Huxtable back to the North of England .
And now , Dr. Huxtable , when you have consumed that milk you will kindly tell me what has happened , when it happened , how it happened , and , finally , what Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable , of the Priory School , near Mackleton , has to do with the matter , and why he comes three days after an <unk> state of your chin gives the <unk> ask for my humble services . &quot;
Our visitor had consumed his milk and <unk> .
The light had come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks as he set himself with great vigour and <unk> to explain the situation .
&quot; I must inform you , gentlemen , that the Priory is a preparatory school , of which I am the founder and principal .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> on Horace &apos; may possibly recall my name to your <unk> .
The Priory is , without exception , the best and most select preparatory school in England .
Lord <unk> , the Earl of <unk> , Sir <unk> <unk> all have <unk> their sons to me .
But I felt that my school had reached its <unk> when , three weeks ago , the Duke of Holdernesse sent Mr. James Wilder , his secretary , with the <unk> that young Lord Saltire , ten years old , his only son and heir , was about to be committed to my charge .
<unk> did I think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my life .
&quot; On May 1st the boy arrived , that being the beginning of the summer term .
He was a charming youth , and he soon fell into our ways .
I may tell <unk> trust that I am not indiscreet , but <unk> are absurd in such a <unk> he was not entirely happy at home .
It is an open secret that the Duke &apos;s married life had not been a peaceful one , and the matter had ended in a <unk> by mutual consent , the Duchess taking up her residence in the South of France .
This had occurred very shortly before , and the boy &apos;s sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother .
He <unk> after her departure from Holdernesse Hall , and it was for this reason that the Duke desired to send him to my establishment .
In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us , and was apparently absolutely happy .
&quot; He was last seen on the night of May <unk> is , the night of last Monday .
His room was on the second floor , and was approached through another larger room in which two boys were sleeping .
These boys saw and heard nothing , so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass out that way .
His window was open , and there is a stout ivy <unk> leading to the ground .
We could trace no footmarks below , but it is sure that this is the only possible exit .
&quot; His absence was discovered at seven o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning .
His bed had been slept in .
He had dressed himself fully before going off in his usual school suit of black Eton jacket and dark grey trousers .
There were no signs that anyone had entered the room , and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of cries , or a struggle , would have been heard , since <unk> , the elder boy in the inner room , is a very light sleeper .
&quot; When Lord Saltire &apos;s disappearance was discovered I at once called a roll of the whole establishment , boys , masters , and servants .
It was then that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not been alone in his flight .
Heidegger , the German master , was missing .
His room was on the second floor , at the farther end of the building , facing the same way as Lord Saltire &apos;s .
His bed had also been slept in ; but he had apparently gone away partly dressed , since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor .
He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy , for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn .
His bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn , and it also was gone .
&quot; He had been with me for two years , and came with the best references ; but he was a silent , morose man , not very popular either with masters or boys .
No trace could be found of the fugitives , and now on Thursday morning we are as ignorant as we were on Tuesday .
<unk> was , of course , made at once at Holdernesse Hall .
It is only a few miles away , and we imagined that in some sudden attack of <unk> he had gone back to his father ; but nothing had been heard of him .
The Duke is <unk> <unk> as to me , you have seen <unk> the state of nervous <unk> to which the <unk> and the responsibility have reduced me .
Mr. Holmes , if ever you put forward your full powers , I implore you to do so now , for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes had listened with the utmost <unk> to the statement of the unhappy schoolmaster .
His drawn brows and the deep furrow between them showed that he needed no <unk> to concentrate all his attention upon a problem which , apart from the tremendous interests involved , must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the unusual .
He now drew out his notebook and <unk> down one or two <unk> .
&quot; You have been very <unk> in not coming to me sooner , &quot; said he , severely .
&quot; You start me on my investigation with a very serious <unk> .
It is inconceivable , for example , that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer . &quot;
&quot; I am not to blame , Mr. Holmes .
His Grace was extremely <unk> to avoid all public scandal .
He was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world .
He has a deep horror of anything of the kind . &quot;
&quot; But there has been some official investigation ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , and it has proved most disappointing .
An apparent clue was at once obtained , since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train .
Only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in Liverpool , and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand .
Then it was that in my despair and disappointment , after a <unk> night , I came straight to you by the early train . &quot;
&quot; I suppose the local investigation was <unk> while this false clue was being followed up ? &quot;
&quot; It was entirely dropped . &quot;
&quot; So that three days have been wasted .
The affair has been most <unk> handled . &quot;
&quot; I feel it , and admit it . &quot;
&quot; And yet the problem should be capable of <unk> solution .
I shall be very happy to look into it .
Have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this German master ? &quot;
&quot; None at all . &quot;
&quot; Was he in the master &apos;s class ? &quot;
&quot; No ; he never exchanged a word with him so far as I know . &quot;
&quot; That is certainly very singular .
Had the boy a bicycle ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Was any other bicycle missing ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Is that certain ? &quot;
&quot; Quite . &quot;
&quot; Well , now , you do not mean to seriously suggest that this German rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night bearing the boy in his arms ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly not . &quot;
&quot; Then what is the theory in your mind ? &quot;
&quot; The bicycle may have been a blind .
It may have been hidden somewhere and the pair gone off on foot . &quot;
&quot; Quite so ; but it seems rather an absurd blind , does it not ?
Were there other bicycles in this shed ? &quot;
&quot; Several . &quot;
&quot; Would he not have hidden a couple he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them ? &quot;
&quot; I suppose he would . &quot;
&quot; Of course he would .
The blind theory won &apos;t do .
But the incident is an admirable startingpoint for an investigation .
After all , a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy .
One other question .
Did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Did he get any letters ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; one letter . &quot;
&quot; From whom ? &quot;
&quot; From his father . &quot;
&quot; Do you open the boys &apos; letters ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; How do you know it was from the father ? &quot;
&quot; The coat of arms was on the envelope , and it was addressed in the Duke &apos;s peculiar stiff hand .
Besides , the Duke <unk> having written . &quot;
&quot; When had he a letter before that ? &quot;
&quot; Not for several days . &quot;
&quot; Had he ever one from France ? &quot;
&quot; No ; never . &quot;
&quot; You see the point of my questions , of course .
Either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will .
In the latter case you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing .
If he has had no visitors , that prompting must have come in letters .
<unk> I try to find out who were his <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I fear I cannot help you much .
His only correspondent , so far as I know , was his own father . &quot;
&quot; Who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance .
Were the relations between father and son very friendly ? &quot;
&quot; His Grace is never very friendly with anyone .
He is completely immersed in large public questions , and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions .
But he was always kind to the boy in his own way . &quot;
&quot; But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Did he say so ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; The Duke , then ? &quot;
&quot; Good heavens , no ! &quot;
&quot; Then how could you know ? &quot;
&quot; I have had some <unk> talks with Mr. James Wilder , his Grace &apos;s secretary .
It was he who gave me the information about Lord Saltire &apos;s feelings . &quot;
&quot; I see .
By the way , that last letter of the Duke <unk> it found in the boy &apos;s room after he was gone ? &quot;
&quot; No ; he had taken it with him .
I think , Mr. Holmes , it is time that we were leaving for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I will order a fourwheeler .
In a quarter of an hour we shall be at your service .
If you are <unk> home , Mr. Huxtable , it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in Liverpool , or wherever else that red <unk> led your pack .
In the meantime I will do a little quiet work at your own doors , and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old <unk> like Watson and myself may get a <unk> of it . &quot;
That evening found us in the cold , bracing atmosphere of the <unk> country , in which Dr. Huxtable &apos;s famous school is situated .
It was already dark when we reached it .
A card was lying on the hall table , and the butler whispered something to his master , who turned to us with agitation in every heavy <unk> .
&quot; The Duke is here , &quot; said he .
&quot; The Duke and Mr. Wilder are in the study .
Come , gentlemen , and I will introduce you . &quot;
I was , of course , familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman , but the man himself was very different from his <unk> .
He was a tall and stately person , <unk> dressed , with a drawn , thin face , and a nose which was <unk> curved and long .
His complexion was of a dead pallor , which was more startling by contrast with a long , dwindling beard of vivid red , which <unk> down over his white waistcoat , with his watchchain gleaming through its fringe .
Such was the stately presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of Dr. Huxtable &apos;s hearthrug .
Beside him stood a very young man , whom I understood to be Wilder , the private secretary .
He was small , nervous , alert , with intelligent , <unk> eyes and <unk> features .
It was he who at once , in an <unk> and positive tone , opened the conversation .
&quot; I called this morning , Dr. Huxtable , too late to prevent you from starting for London .
I learned that your object was to <unk> Mr. Sherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct of this case .
His Grace is surprised , Dr. Huxtable , that you should have taken such a step without consulting him . &quot;
&quot; When I learned that the police had failed &quot; &quot; His Grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed . &quot;
&quot; But surely , Mr. Wilder &quot; &quot; You are well aware , Dr. Huxtable , that his Grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal .
He <unk> to take as few people as possible into his confidence . &quot;
&quot; The matter can be easily <unk> , &quot; said the <unk> doctor ; &quot; Mr. Sherlock Holmes can return to London by the morning train . &quot;
&quot; Hardly that , <unk> , hardly that , &quot; said Holmes , in his blandest voice .
&quot; This <unk> air is <unk> and pleasant , so I propose to spend a few days upon your <unk> , and to <unk> my mind as best I may .
Whether I have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is , of course , for you to decide . &quot;
I could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of <unk> , from which he was <unk> by the deep , <unk> voice of the <unk> Duke , which boomed out like a <unk> .
&quot; I agree with Mr. Wilder , Dr. Huxtable , that you would have done <unk> to consult me .
But since Mr. Holmes has already been taken into your confidence , it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services .
Far from going to the inn , Mr. Holmes , I should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse Hall . &quot;
&quot; I thank your Grace .
For the purposes of my investigation I think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery . &quot;
&quot; Just as you like , Mr. Holmes .
Any information which Mr. Wilder or I can give you is , of course , at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; It will probably be necessary for me to see you at the Hall , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I would only ask you now , sir , whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , I have not . &quot;
&quot; Excuse me if I allude to that which is painful to you , but I have no alternative .
Do you think that the Duchess had anything to do with the matter ? &quot;
The great Minister showed <unk> hesitation .
&quot; I do not think so , &quot; he said , at last .
&quot; The other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of <unk> ransom .
You have not had any demand of the sort ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; One more question , your Grace .
I understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred . &quot;
&quot; No ; I wrote upon the day before . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
But he received it on that day ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Was there anything in your letter which might have <unk> him or <unk> him to take such a step ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , certainly not . &quot;
&quot; Did you post that letter yourself ? &quot;
The nobleman &apos;s reply was interrupted by his secretary , who broke in with some heat .
&quot; His Grace is not in the habit of <unk> letters himself , &quot; said he .
&quot; This letter was laid with others upon the study table , and I myself put them in the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You are sure this one was among them ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; I observed it . &quot;
&quot; How many letters did your Grace write that day ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> or thirty .
I have a large <unk> .
But surely this is somewhat <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Not entirely , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; For my own part , &quot; the Duke continued , &quot; I have advised the police to turn their attention to the South of France .
I have already said that I do not believe that the Duchess would <unk> so monstrous an action , but the lad had the most <unk> <unk> , and it is possible that he may have fled to her , aided and <unk> by this German .
I think , Dr. Huxtable , that we will now return to the Hall . &quot;
I could see that there were other questions which Holmes would have wished to put ; but the nobleman &apos;s abrupt manner showed that the interview was at an end .
It was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this <unk> of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent , and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a <unk> light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history .
When the nobleman and his secretary had left , my friend flung himself at once with <unk> eagerness into the investigation .
The boy &apos;s chamber was carefully examined , and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could have escaped .
The German master &apos;s room and <unk> gave no further clue .
In his case a <unk> of ivy had given way under his weight , and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come down .
That one <unk> in the short green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight .
Sherlock Holmes left the house alone , and only returned after eleven .
He had obtained a large <unk> map of the neighbourhood , and this he brought into my room , where he laid it out on the bed , and , having <unk> the lamp in the middle of it , he began to smoke over it , and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the <unk> <unk> of his pipe .
&quot; This case grows upon me , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; There are <unk> some points of interest in connection with it .
In this early stage I want you to realize those <unk> features which may have a good deal to do with our investigation .
&quot; Look at this map .
This dark square is the Priory School .
I &apos;ll put a <unk> in it .
Now , this line is the main road .
You see that it runs east and west past the school , and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either way .
If these two folk passed away by road it was this road . &quot;
Picture : <unk> of the surrounding area &quot; Exactly . &quot;
&quot; By a singular and happy chance we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question .
At this point , where my pipe is now <unk> , a country constable was on duty from twelve to six .
It is , as you perceive , the first cross road on the east side .
This man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant , and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen .
I have spoken with this policeman tonight , and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person .
That blocks this end .
We have now to deal with the other .
There is an inn here , the Red <unk> , the landlady of which was ill . She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor , but he did not arrive until morning , being absent at another case .
The people at the inn were alert all night , awaiting his coming , and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road .
They <unk> that no one passed .
If their evidence is good , then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west , and also to be able to say that the fugitives did not use the road at all . &quot;
&quot; But the bicycle ? &quot;
I <unk> .
&quot; Quite so .
We will come to the bicycle presently .
To continue our reasoning : if these people did not go by the road , they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house .
That is certain .
Let us <unk> the one against the other .
On the south of the house is , as you perceive , a large district of <unk> land , cut up into small fields , with stone walls between them .
There , I admit that a bicycle is impossible .
We can dismiss the idea .
We turn to the country on the north .
Here there lies a grove of trees , marked as the &apos; Ragged Shaw , &apos; and on the farther side <unk> a great rolling moor , Lower Gill Moor , <unk> for ten miles and sloping gradually upwards .
Here , at one side of this <unk> , is Holdernesse Hall , ten miles by road , but only six across the moor .
It is a peculiarly <unk> <unk> .
A few moor farmers have small <unk> , where they rear sheep and cattle .
Except these , the <unk> and the <unk> are the only <unk> until you come to the Chesterfield high road .
There is a church there , you see , a few cottages , and an inn .
<unk> that the <unk> become <unk> .
Surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie . &quot;
&quot; But the bicycle ? &quot;
I <unk> .
&quot; Well , well ! &quot;
said Holmes , impatiently .
&quot; A good cyclist does not need a high road .
The moor is intersected with paths and the <unk> was at the full .
Halloa !
what is this ? &quot;
There was an agitated knock at the door , and an instant afterwards Dr. Huxtable was in the room .
In his hand he held a blue <unk> , with a white <unk> on the <unk> .
&quot; At last we have a clue ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; Thank Heaven !
at last we are on the dear boy &apos;s track !
It is his cap . &quot;
&quot; Where was it found ? &quot;
&quot; In the <unk> of the gipsies who <unk> on the moor .
They left on Tuesday .
Today the police traced them down and examined their <unk> .
This was found . &quot;
&quot; How do they account for it ? &quot;
&quot; They <unk> and <unk> that they found it on the moor on Tuesday morning .
They know where he is , the rascals !
Thank goodness , they are all safe under lock and key .
Either the fear of the law or the Duke &apos;s purse will certainly get out of them all that they know . &quot;
&quot; So far , so good , &quot; said Holmes , when the doctor had at last left the room .
&quot; It at least <unk> out the theory that it is on the side of the Lower Gill Moor that we must hope for results .
The police have really done nothing <unk> , save the arrest of these gipsies .
Look here , Watson !
There is a watercourse across the moor .
You see it marked here in the map .
In some parts it <unk> into a morass .
This is particularly so in the <unk> between Holdernesse Hall and the school .
It is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather ; but at that point there is certainly a chance of some record being left .
I will call you early tomorrow morning , and you and I will try if we can throw some little light upon the mystery . &quot;
The day was just breaking when I <unk> to find the long , thin form of Holmes by my <unk> .
He was fully dressed , and had apparently already been out .
&quot; I have done the lawn and the bicycle shed , &quot; said he .
&quot; I have also had a <unk> through the Ragged Shaw .
Now , Watson , there is <unk> ready in the next room .
I must beg you to hurry , for we have a great day before us . &quot;
His eyes shone , and his cheek was flushed with the <unk> of the master workman who sees his work lie ready before him .
A very different Holmes , this active , alert man , from the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of Baker Street .
I felt , as I looked upon that <unk> figure , alive with nervous energy , that it was indeed a <unk> day that awaited us .
And yet it opened in the blackest disappointment .
With high hopes we struck across the <unk> , <unk> moor , intersected with a thousand sheep paths , until we came to the broad , <unk> <unk> which marked the morass between us and Holdernesse .
Certainly , if the lad had gone <unk> , he must have passed this , and he could not pass it without leaving his traces .
But no sign of him or the German could be seen .
With a darkening face my friend strode along the margin , eagerly observant of every muddy stain upon the <unk> surface .
<unk> there were in <unk> , and at one place , some miles down , cows had left their tracks .
Nothing more .
&quot; <unk> number one , &quot; said Holmes , looking gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor .
&quot; There is another morass down yonder and a narrow neck between .
Halloa !
halloa !
halloa !
what have we here ? &quot;
We had come on a small black <unk> of pathway .
In the middle of it , clearly marked on the sodden soil , was the track of a bicycle .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; We have it . &quot;
But Holmes was shaking his head , and his face was puzzled and <unk> rather than <unk> .
&quot; A bicycle , certainly , but not the bicycle , &quot; said he .
&quot; I am familiar with <unk> different <unk> left by tyres .
This , as you perceive , is a Dunlop , with a patch upon the outer cover .
Heidegger &apos;s tyres were Palmer &apos;s , leaving <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> master , was sure upon the point .
Therefore , it is not Heidegger &apos;s track . &quot;
&quot; The boy &apos;s , then ? &quot;
&quot; Possibly , if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession .
But this we have utterly failed to do .
This track , as you perceive , was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school . &quot;
&quot; Or towards it ? &quot;
&quot; No , no , my dear Watson .
The more deeply sunk impression is , of course , the hind wheel , upon which the weight <unk> .
You perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one .
It was undoubtedly heading away from the school .
It may or may not be connected with our inquiry , but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther . &quot;
We did so , and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the <unk> portion of the moor .
<unk> the path backwards , we picked out another spot , where a spring trickled across it .
Here , once again , was the mark of the bicycle , though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows .
After that there was no sign , but the path ran right on into Ragged Shaw , the wood which <unk> on to the school .
From this wood the cycle must have emerged .
Holmes sat down on a <unk> and rested his chin in his hands .
I had smoked two cigarettes before he moved .
&quot; Well , well , &quot; said he , at last .
&quot; It is , of course , possible that a cunning man might change the tyre of his bicycle in order to leave <unk> tracks .
A criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom I should be proud to do business with .
We will leave this question <unk> and hark back to our morass again , for we have left a good deal <unk> . &quot;
We continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion of the moor , and soon our perseverance was <unk> <unk> .
Right across the lower part of the <unk> lay a <unk> path .
Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it .
An impression like a fine bundle of telegraph <unk> ran down the centre of it .
It was the Palmer tyre .
&quot; Here is <unk> Heidegger , sure enough ! &quot;
cried Holmes , <unk> .
&quot; My reasoning seems to have been pretty sound , Watson . &quot;
&quot; I congratulate you . &quot;
&quot; But we have a long way still to go .
Kindly walk clear of the path .
Now let us follow the trail .
I fear that it will not lead very far . &quot;
We found , however , as we advanced that this portion of the moor is intersected with soft patches , and , though we frequently lost sight of the track , we always succeeded in picking it up once more .
&quot; Do you observe , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; that the rider is now undoubtedly <unk> the pace ?
There can be no doubt of it .
Look at this impression , where you get both tyres clear .
The one is as deep as the other .
That can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handlebar , as a man does when he is <unk> .
By Jove !
he has had a fall . &quot;
There was a broad , irregular <unk> covering some yards of the track .
Then there were a few footmarks , and the tyre reappeared once more .
&quot; A <unk> , &quot; I suggested .
Holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse .
To my horror I perceived that the yellow <unk> were all <unk> with crimson .
On the path , too , and among the <unk> were dark stains of <unk> blood .
&quot; Bad ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Bad !
Stand clear , Watson !
Not an unnecessary <unk> !
What do I read here ?
He fell wounded , he stood up , he <unk> , he <unk> .
But there is no other track .
<unk> on this side path .
He was surely not <unk> by a bull ?
Impossible !
But I see no traces of anyone else .
We must push on , Watson .
Surely with stains as well as the track to guide us he cannot escape us now . &quot;
Our search was not a very long one .
The tracks of the tyre began to curve <unk> upon the wet and shining path .
Suddenly , as I looked ahead , the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick gorse bushes .
Out of them we dragged a bicycle , <unk> , one pedal bent , and the whole front of it horribly <unk> and <unk> with blood .
On the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting .
We ran round , and there lay the unfortunate rider .
He was a tall man , full bearded , with spectacles , one glass of which had been knocked out .
The cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head , which had crushed in part of his skull .
That he could have gone on after receiving such an injury said much for the <unk> and courage of the man .
He wore shoes , but no socks , and his open coat disclosed a nightshirt beneath it .
It was undoubtedly the German master .
Holmes turned the body over <unk> , and examined it with great attention .
He then sat in deep thought for a time , and I could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not , in his opinion , advanced us much in our inquiry .
&quot; It is a little difficult to know what to do , Watson , &quot; said he , at last .
&quot; My own <unk> are to push this inquiry on , for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour .
On the other hand , we are bound to inform the police of the discovery , and to see that this poor fellow &apos;s body is looked after . &quot;
&quot; I could take a note back . &quot;
&quot; But I need your company and assistance .
Wait a bit !
There is a fellow cutting <unk> up yonder .
<unk> him over here , and he will guide the police . &quot;
I brought the peasant across , and Holmes dispatched the frightened man with a note to Dr. Huxtable .
&quot; Now , Watson , &quot; said he , &quot; we have picked up two clues this morning .
One is the bicycle with the Palmer tyre , and we see what that has led to .
The other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop .
Before we start to investigate that , let us try to realize what we do know so as to make the most of it , and to separate the essential from the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; First of all I wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free will .
He got down from his window and he went off , either alone or with someone .
That is sure . &quot;
I <unk> .
&quot; Well , now , let us turn to this unfortunate German master .
The boy was fully dressed when he fled .
Therefore , he <unk> what he would do .
But the German went without his socks .
He certainly acted on very short notice . &quot;
&quot; Undoubtedly . &quot;
&quot; Why did he go ?
Because , from his bedroom window , he saw the flight of the boy .
Because he wished to overtake him and bring him back .
He seized his bicycle , pursued the lad , and in pursuing him met his death . &quot;
&quot; So it would seem . &quot;
&quot; Now I come to the <unk> part of my argument .
The natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him .
He would know that he could overtake him .
But the German does not do so .
He turns to his bicycle .
I am told that he was an excellent cyclist .
He would not do this if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape . &quot;
&quot; The other bicycle . &quot;
&quot; Let us continue our <unk> .
He meets his death five miles from the <unk> by a bullet , mark you , which even a lad might conceivably <unk> , but by a savage blow <unk> by a vigorous arm .
The lad , then , had a companion in his flight .
And the flight was a swift one , since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them .
Yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy .
What do we find ?
A few cattle tracks , nothing more .
I took a wide sweep round , and there is no path within fifty yards .
Another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder .
<unk> were there any human footmarks . &quot;
&quot; Holmes , &quot; I cried , &quot; this is impossible . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
he said .
&quot; A most <unk> remark .
It is impossible as I state it , and therefore I must in some respect have stated it wrong .
Yet you saw for yourself .
Can you suggest any <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; He could not have <unk> his skull in a fall ? &quot;
&quot; In a morass , Watson ? &quot;
&quot; I am at my wit &apos;s end . &quot;
&quot; Tut , tut ; we have solved some worse problems .
At least we have plenty of material , if we can only use it .
Come , then , and , having exhausted the Palmer , let us see what the Dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us . &quot;
We picked up the track and followed it onwards for some distance ; but soon the moor rose into a long , <unk> curve , and we left the watercourse behind us .
No further help from tracks could be hoped for .
At the spot where we saw the last of the Dunlop tyre it might equally have led to Holdernesse Hall , the stately towers of which rose some miles to our left , or to a low , grey village which lay in front of us , and marked the position of the Chesterfield high road .
As we approached the <unk> and squalid inn , with the sign of a <unk> above the door , Holmes gave a sudden groan and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling .
He had had one of those violent <unk> of the ankle which leave a man helpless .
With difficulty he <unk> up to the door , where a squat , dark , elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe .
&quot; How are you , Mr. Reuben Hayes ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Who are you , and how do you get my name so <unk> ? &quot;
the <unk> answered , with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s printed on the board above your head .
It &apos;s easy to see a man who is master of his own house .
I suppose you haven &apos;t such a thing as a carriage in your stables ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I have not . &quot;
&quot; I can hardly put my foot to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t put it to the ground . &quot;
&quot; But I can &apos;t walk . &quot;
&quot; Well , then , <unk> . &quot;
Mr. Reuben Hayes &apos;s manner was far from gracious , but Holmes took it with admirable goodhumour .
&quot; Look here , my man , &quot; said he .
&quot; This is really rather an awkward fix for me .
I don &apos;t mind how I get on . &quot;
&quot; Neither do I , &quot; said the morose landlord .
&quot; The matter is very important .
I would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle . &quot;
The landlord pricked up his ears .
&quot; Where do you want to go ? &quot;
&quot; To Holdernesse Hall . &quot;
&quot; <unk> of the Dook , I suppose ? &quot;
said the landlord , <unk> our <unk> <unk> with ironical eyes .
Holmes laughed <unk> .
&quot; He &apos;ll be glad to see us , anyhow . &quot;
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Because we bring him news of his lost son . &quot;
The landlord gave a very visible start .
&quot; What , you &apos;re on his track ? &quot;
&quot; He has been heard of in Liverpool .
They expect to get him every hour . &quot;
Again a swift change passed over the heavy , unshaven face .
His manner was suddenly <unk> .
&quot; I &apos;ve less reason to wish the Dook well than most men , &quot; said he , &quot; for I was his head coachman once , and cruel bad he treated me .
It was him that <unk> me without a character on the word of a lying <unk> .
But I &apos;m glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in Liverpool , and I &apos;ll help you to take the news to the Hall . &quot;
&quot; Thank you , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; We &apos;ll have some food first .
Then you can bring round the bicycle . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t got a bicycle . &quot;
Holmes held up a sovereign .
&quot; I tell you , man , that I haven &apos;t got one .
I &apos;ll let you have two horses as far as the Hall . &quot;
&quot; Well , well , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; we &apos;ll talk about it when we &apos;ve had something to <unk> . &quot;
When we were left alone in the <unk> kitchen it was astonishing how rapidly that <unk> ankle recovered .
It was nearly <unk> , and we had <unk> nothing since early morning , so that we spent some time over our meal .
Holmes was lost in thought , and once or twice he walked over to the window and stared earnestly out .
It opened on to a squalid courtyard .
In the far corner was a smithy , where a <unk> lad was at work .
On the other side were the stables .
Holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions , when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation .
&quot; By Heaven , Watson , I believe that I &apos;ve got it ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; Yes , yes , it must be so .
Watson , do you remember seeing any <unk> today ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , several . &quot;
&quot; Where ? &quot;
&quot; Well , <unk> .
They were at the morass , and again on the path , and again near where poor Heidegger met his death . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
Well , now , Watson , how many cows did you see on the moor ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t remember seeing any . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , Watson , that we should see tracks all along our line , but never a cow on the whole moor ; very strange , Watson , eh ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , it is strange . &quot;
&quot; Now , Watson , make an effort ; throw your mind back !
Can you see those tracks upon the path ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I can . &quot;
&quot; Can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that , Watson &quot; he arranged a number of <unk> in this fashion : : : : : &quot; and sometimes like this &quot; : ` : ` : ` : ` &quot; and occasionally like this &quot; .
` .
` .
` .
&quot; Can you remember that ? &quot;
&quot; No , I cannot . &quot;
&quot; But I can .
I could swear to it .
However , we will go back at our leisure and <unk> it .
What a blind beetle I have been not to draw my conclusion ! &quot;
&quot; And what is your conclusion ? &quot;
&quot; Only that it is a remarkable cow which <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
By George , Watson , it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that !
The coast seems to be clear , save for that lad in the smithy .
Let us slip out and see what we can see . &quot;
There were two <unk> , unkempt horses in the <unk> stable .
Holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed aloud .
&quot; Old shoes , but <unk> <unk> shoes , but new nails .
This case <unk> to be a classic .
Let us go across to the smithy . &quot;
The lad continued his work without <unk> us .
I saw Holmes &apos;s eye darting to right and left among the <unk> of iron and wood which was scattered about the floor .
Suddenly , however , we heard a step behind us , and there was the landlord , his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes , his swarthy features convulsed with <unk> .
He held a short , <unk> stick in his hand , and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket .
&quot; You infernal spies ! &quot;
the man cried .
&quot; What are you doing there ? &quot;
&quot; Why , Mr. Reuben Hayes , &quot; said Holmes , <unk> , &quot; one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out . &quot;
The man mastered himself with a violent effort , and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh , which was more menacing than his frown .
&quot; You &apos;re welcome to all you can find out in my smithy , &quot; said he .
&quot; But look here , mister , I don &apos;t care for folk <unk> about my place without my leave , so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better I shall be pleased . &quot;
&quot; All right , Mr. <unk> harm meant , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; We have been having a look at your horses , but I think I &apos;ll walk after all .
It &apos;s not far , I believe . &quot;
&quot; Not more than two miles to the Hall gates .
That &apos;s the road to the left . &quot;
He watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises .
We did not go very far along the road , for Holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us from the landlord &apos;s view .
&quot; We were warm , as the children say , at that inn , &quot; said he .
&quot; I seem to grow <unk> every step that I take away from it .
No , no ; I can &apos;t possibly leave it . &quot;
&quot; I am convinced , &quot; said I , &quot; that this Reuben Hayes knows all about it .
A more <unk> villain I never saw . &quot;
&quot; Oh !
he impressed you in that way , did he ?
There are the horses , there is the smithy .
Yes , it is an interesting place , this Fighting Cock .
I think we shall have another look at it in an <unk> way . &quot;
A long , sloping <unk> , <unk> with grey <unk> <unk> , stretched behind us .
We had turned off the road , and were making our way up the hill , when , looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall , I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along .
&quot; Get down , Watson ! &quot;
cried Holmes , with a heavy hand upon my shoulder .
We had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road .
Amid a rolling cloud of dust I caught a glimpse of a pale , agitated facea face with horror in every <unk> , the mouth open , the eyes staring wildly in front .
It was like some strange <unk> of the dapper James Wilder whom we had seen the night before .
&quot; The Duke &apos;s secretary ! &quot;
cried Holmes .
&quot; Come , Watson , let us see what he does . &quot;
We scrambled from rock to rock until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn .
Wilder &apos;s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it .
No one was moving about the house , nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows .
<unk> the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall .
Then in the gloom we saw the two <unk> of a trap light up in the stable yard of the inn , and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs , as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of Chesterfield .
&quot; What do you make of that , Watson ? &quot;
Holmes whispered .
&quot; It looks like a flight . &quot;
&quot; A single man in a dogcart , so far as I could see .
Well , it certainly was not Mr. James Wilder , for there he is at the door . &quot;
A red square of light had sprung out of the darkness .
In the middle of it was the black figure of the secretary , his head advanced , peering out into the night .
It was evident that he was expecting someone .
Then at last there were steps in the road , a second figure was visible for an instant against the light , the door shut , and all was black once more .
Five minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor .
&quot; It seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the Fighting Cock , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; The bar is on the other side . &quot;
&quot; Quite so .
These are what one may call the private <unk> .
Now , what in the world is Mr. James Wilder doing in that den at this hour of night , and who is the companion who comes to meet him there ?
Come , Watson , we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely . &quot;
Together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the inn .
The bicycle still leaned against the wall .
Holmes struck a match and held it to the back wheel , and I heard him chuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop tyre .
Up above us was the lighted window .
&quot; I must have a peep through that , Watson .
If you <unk> your back and support yourself upon the wall , I think that I can manage . &quot;
An instant later his feet were on my shoulders .
But he was hardly up before he was down again .
&quot; Come , my friend , &quot; said he , &quot; our day &apos;s work has been quite long enough .
I think that we have gathered all that we can .
It &apos;s a long walk to the school , and the sooner we get started the better . &quot;
He hardly opened his lips during that weary <unk> across the moor , nor would he enter the school when he reached it , but went on to Mackleton Station , whence he could send some telegrams .
Late at night I heard him <unk> Dr. Huxtable , <unk> by the tragedy of his master &apos;s death , and later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the morning .
&quot; All goes well , my friend , &quot; said he .
&quot; I promise that before tomorrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery . &quot;
At eleven o &apos;clock next morning my friend and I were walking up the famous yew avenue of Holdernesse Hall .
We were ushered through the magnificent <unk> doorway and into his Grace &apos;s study .
There we found Mr. James Wilder , <unk> and <unk> , but with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features .
&quot; You have come to see his Grace ?
I am sorry ; but the fact is that the Duke is far from well .
He has been very much upset by the tragic news .
We received a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday afternoon , which told us of your discovery . &quot;
&quot; I must see the Duke , Mr.
Wilder . &quot;
&quot; But he is in his room . &quot;
&quot; Then I must go to his room . &quot;
&quot; I believe he is in his bed . &quot;
&quot; I will see him there . &quot;
Holmes &apos;s cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was useless to <unk> with him .
&quot; Very good , Mr. Holmes ; I will tell him that you are here . &quot;
After half an hour &apos;s delay the great nobleman appeared .
His face was more <unk> than ever , his shoulders had rounded , and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before .
He greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk , his red beard <unk> down on to the table .
&quot; Well , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
said he .
But my friend &apos;s eyes were fixed upon the secretary , who stood by his master &apos;s chair .
&quot; I think , your Grace , that I could speak more freely in Mr. Wilder &apos;s absence . &quot;
The man turned a shade <unk> and cast a malignant glance at Holmes .
&quot; If your Grace wishes &quot; &quot; Yes , yes ; you had better go .
Now , Mr. Holmes , what have you to say ? &quot;
My friend waited until the door had closed behind the <unk> secretary .
&quot; The fact is , your Grace , &quot; said he , &quot; that my colleague , Dr. Watson , and myself had an assurance from Dr. Huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case .
I should like to have this confirmed from your own lips . &quot;
&quot; Certainly , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; It amounted , if I am <unk> informed , to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly . &quot;
&quot; And another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly . &quot;
&quot; Under the latter heading is <unk> , no doubt , not only those who may have taken him away , but also those who <unk> to keep him in his present position ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes , &quot; cried the Duke , impatiently .
&quot; If you do your work well , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , you will have no reason to complain of <unk> treatment . &quot;
My friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of <unk> which was a surprise to me , who knew his frugal <unk> .
&quot; I fancy that I see your Grace &apos;s chequebook upon the table , &quot; said he .
&quot; I should be glad if you would make me out a cheque for six thousand pounds .
It would be as well , perhaps , for you to cross it .
The Capital and <unk> Bank , Oxford Street branch , are my agents . &quot;
His Grace sat very stern and <unk> in his chair , and looked stonily at my friend .
&quot; Is this a joke , Mr. Holmes ?
It is hardly a subject for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Not at all , your Grace .
I was never more earnest in my life . &quot;
&quot; What do you mean , then ? &quot;
&quot; I mean that I have earned the reward .
I know where your son is , and I know some , at least , of those who are holding him . &quot;
The Duke &apos;s beard had turned more <unk> red than ever against his ghastly white face .
&quot; Where is he ? &quot;
he gasped .
&quot; He is , or was last night , at the Fighting Cock Inn , about two miles from your park gate . &quot;
The Duke fell back in his chair .
&quot; And whom do you accuse ? &quot;
Sherlock Holmes &apos;s answer was an <unk> one .
He stepped swiftly forward and touched the Duke upon the shoulder .
&quot; I accuse you , &quot; said he .
&quot; And now , your Grace , I &apos;ll trouble you for that cheque . &quot;
Never shall I forget the Duke &apos;s appearance as he sprang up and clawed with his hands like one who is sinking into an abyss .
Then , with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic selfcommand , he sat down and sank his face in his hands .
It was some minutes before he spoke .
&quot; How much do you know ? &quot;
he asked at last , without <unk> his head .
&quot; I saw you together last night . &quot;
&quot; Does anyone else besides your friend know ? &quot;
&quot; I have spoken to no one . &quot;
The Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his chequebook .
&quot; I shall be as good as my word , Mr. Holmes .
I am about to write your cheque , however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me .
When the offer was first made I little thought the turn which events might take .
But you and your friend are men of discretion , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; I hardly understand your Grace . &quot;
&quot; I must put it <unk> , Mr. Holmes .
If only you two know of this incident , there is no reason why it should go any farther .
I think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that I owe you , is it not ? &quot;
But Holmes smiled and shook his head .
&quot; I fear , your Grace , that matters can hardly be arranged so easily .
There is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for . &quot;
&quot; But James knew nothing of that .
You cannot hold him responsible for that .
It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ . &quot;
&quot; I must take the view , your Grace , that when a man <unk> upon a crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , Mr. Holmes .
No doubt you are right .
But surely not in the eyes of the law .
A man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present , and which he <unk> and <unk> as much as you do .
The instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me , so filled was he with horror and <unk> .
He lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer .
Oh , Mr. Holmes , you must save <unk> must save him !
I tell you that you must save him ! &quot;
The Duke had dropped the last attempt at selfcommand , and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands <unk> in the air .
At last he mastered himself and sat down once more at his desk .
&quot; I appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else , &quot; said he .
&quot; At least , we may take counsel how far we can <unk> this hideous scandal . &quot;
&quot; Exactly , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I think , your Grace , that this can only be done by absolute and complete frankness between us .
I am <unk> to help your Grace to the best of my <unk> ; but in order to do so I must understand to the last detail how the matter stands .
I realize that your words applied to Mr. James Wilder , and that he is not the murderer . &quot;
&quot; No ; the murderer has escaped . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes smiled <unk> .
&quot; Your Grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which I possess , or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me .
Mr. Reuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on my information at eleven o &apos;clock last night .
I had a telegram from the head of the local police before I left the school this morning . &quot;
The Duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my friend .
&quot; You seem to have powers that are hardly human , &quot; said he .
&quot; So Reuben Hayes is taken ?
I am right glad to hear it , if it will not <unk> upon the fate of James . &quot;
&quot; Your secretary ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; my son . &quot;
It was Holmes &apos;s turn to look astonished .
&quot; I confess that this is entirely new to me , your Grace .
I must beg you to be more <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I will conceal nothing from you .
I agree with you that complete frankness , however painful it may be to me , is the best <unk> in this desperate situation to which James &apos;s <unk> and jealousy have reduced us .
When I was a very young man , Mr. Holmes , I loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime .
I offered the lady marriage , but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might <unk> my career .
Had she lived I would certainly never have married anyone else .
She died , and left this one child , whom for her sake I have <unk> and cared for .
I could not acknowledge the <unk> to the world ; but I gave him the best of <unk> , and since he came to manhood I have kept him near my person .
He surprised my secret , and has <unk> ever since upon the claim which he has upon me and upon his power of provoking a scandal , which would be abhorrent to me .
His presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage .
Above all , he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a <unk> hatred .
You may well ask me why , under these circumstances , I still kept James under my roof .
I answer that it was because I could see his mother &apos;s face in his , and that for her dear sake there was no end to my longsuffering .
All her pretty ways , <unk> was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory .
I could not send him away .
But I feared so much lest he should do <unk> is , Lord <unk> mischief that I dispatched him for safety to Dr. Huxtable &apos;s school .
&quot; James came into contact with this fellow Hayes because the man was a tenant of mine , and James acted as agent .
The fellow was a rascal from the beginning ; but in some extraordinary way James became intimate with him .
He had always a taste for low company .
When James determined to <unk> Lord Saltire it was of this man &apos;s service that he <unk> himself .
You remember that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day .
Well , James opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the Ragged Shaw , which is near to the school .
He used the Duchess &apos;s name , and in that way got the boy to come .
That evening James <unk> <unk> am telling you what he has himself confessed to <unk> he told Arthur , whom he met in the wood , that his mother longed to see him , that she was awaiting him on the moor , and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse , who would take him to her .
Poor Arthur fell into the trap .
He came to the appointment and found this fellow Hayes with a led <unk> .
Arthur mounted , and they set off together .
It <unk> this James only heard <unk> they were pursued , that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick , and that the man died of his injuries .
Hayes brought Arthur to his publichouse , the Fighting Cock , where he was <unk> in an upper room , under the care of Mrs. Hayes , who is a kindly woman , but entirely under the control of her brutal husband .
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , that was the state of affairs when I first saw you two days ago .
I had no more idea of the truth than you .
You will ask me what was James &apos;s motive in doing such a deed .
I answer that there was a great deal which was <unk> and <unk> in the hatred which he bore my heir .
In his view he should himself have been heir of all my <unk> , and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible .
At the same time he had a definite motive also .
He was eager that I should break the entail , and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so .
He intended to make a bargain with <unk> <unk> Arthur if I would break the entail , and so make it possible for the estate to be left to him by will .
He knew well that I should never willingly <unk> the aid of the police against him .
I say that he would have proposed such a bargain to me , but he did not actually do so , for events moved too quickly for him , and he had not time to put his plans into practice .
&quot; What brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man Heidegger &apos;s dead body .
James was seized with horror at the news .
It came to us yesterday as we sat together in this study .
Dr. Huxtable had sent a telegram .
James was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions , which had never been entirely absent , rose instantly to a certainty , and I <unk> him with the deed .
He made a complete <unk> confession .
Then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer , so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of <unk> his guilty life .
I <unk> I have always <unk> his <unk> , and instantly James hurried off to the Fighting Cock to warn Hayes and give him the means of flight .
I could not go there by daylight without provoking comment , but as soon as night fell I hurried off to see my dear Arthur .
I found him safe and well , but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed .
In <unk> to my promise , and much against my will , I <unk> to leave him there for three days under the charge of Mrs. Hayes , since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer , and I could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate James .
You asked for frankness , Mr. Holmes , and I have taken you at your word , for I have now told you everything without an attempt at <unk> or concealment .
Do you in turn be as frank with me . &quot;
&quot; I will , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; In the first place , your Grace , I am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law .
You have <unk> a felony and you have aided the escape of a murderer ; for I cannot doubt that any money which was taken by James Wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your Grace &apos;s purse . &quot;
The Duke bowed his assent .
&quot; This is indeed a most serious matter .
Even more culpable in my opinion , your Grace , is your attitude towards your younger son .
You leave him in this den for three days . &quot;
&quot; Under solemn promises &quot; &quot; What are promises to such people as these ?
You have no <unk> that he will not be spirited away again .
To humour your guilty elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to <unk> and unnecessary danger .
It was a most <unk> action . &quot;
The proud lord of Holdernesse was not accustomed to be so <unk> in his own ducal hall .
The blood flushed into his high forehead , but his conscience held him <unk> .
&quot; I will help you , but on one condition only .
It is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as I like . &quot;
Without a word the Duke pressed the electric bell .
A servant entered .
&quot; You will be glad to hear , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; that your young master is found .
It is the Duke &apos;s desire that the carriage shall go at once to the Fighting Cock Inn to bring Lord Saltire home .
&quot; Now , &quot; said Holmes , when the rejoicing <unk> had disappeared , &quot; having secured the future , we can afford to be more <unk> with the past .
I am not in an official position , and there is no reason , so long as the ends of justice are served , why I should disclose all that I know .
As to Hayes I say nothing .
The gallows awaits him , and I would do nothing to save him from it .
What he will <unk> I cannot tell , but I have no doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent .
From the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom .
If they do not themselves find it out I see no reason why I should <unk> them to take a <unk> point of view .
I would warn your Grace , however , that the continued presence of Mr. James Wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune . &quot;
&quot; I understand that , Mr. Holmes , and it is already settled that he shall leave me for ever and go to seek his fortune in Australia . &quot;
&quot; In that case , your Grace , since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence , I would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the Duchess , and that you try to <unk> those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted . &quot;
&quot; That also I have arranged , Mr. Holmes .
I wrote to the Duchess this morning . &quot;
&quot; In that case , &quot; said Holmes , rising , &quot; I think that my friend and I can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the North .
There is one other small point upon which I desire some light .
This fellow Hayes had <unk> his horses with shoes which <unk> the tracks of cows .
Was it from Mr. Wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device ? &quot;
The Duke stood in thought for a moment , with a look of intense surprise on his face .
Then he opened a door and showed us into a large room furnished as a <unk> .
He led the way to a glass case in a corner , and pointed to the inscription .
&quot; These shoes , &quot; it ran , &quot; were dug up in the <unk> of Holdernesse Hall .
They are for the use of horses ; but they are <unk> below with a <unk> foot of iron , so as to throw pursuers off the track .
They are <unk> to have belonged to some of the <unk> <unk> of Holdernesse in the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Holmes opened the case , and <unk> his finger he passed it along the shoe .
A thin <unk> of recent <unk> was left upon his skin .
&quot; Thank you , &quot; said he , as he replaced the glass .
&quot; It is the second most interesting object that I have seen in the North . &quot;
&quot; And the first ? &quot;
Holmes folded up his cheque and placed it carefully in his notebook .
&quot; I am a poor man , &quot; said he , as he <unk> it <unk> and thrust it into the depths of his inner pocket .
I have never known my friend to be in better form , both mental and physical , than in the year &apos; 95 .
His <unk> fame had brought with it an immense practice , and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in Baker Street .
Holmes , however , like all great <unk> , lived for his art &apos;s sake , and , save in the case of the Duke of Holdernesse , I have seldom known him claim any large reward for his <unk> services .
So <unk> was <unk> so <unk> he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies , while he would devote weeks of most intense <unk> to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and <unk> his ingenuity .
In this <unk> year &apos; 95 a curious and <unk> succession of cases had engaged his attention , <unk> from his famous investigation of the sudden death of <unk> <unk> inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of His <unk> the <unk> to his arrest of Wilson , the notorious <unk> , which removed a <unk> from the <unk> of London .
<unk> on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of Woodman &apos;s Lee , and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of Captain Peter Carey .
No record of the <unk> of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete which did not <unk> some account of this very unusual affair .
During the first week of July my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that I knew he had something on hand .
The fact that several roughlooking men called during that time and inquired for Captain Basil made me understand that Holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous <unk> and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity .
He had at least five small <unk> in different parts of London in which he was able to change his personality .
He said nothing of his business to me , and it was not my habit to force a confidence .
The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one .
He had gone out before breakfast , and I had sat down to mine , when he strode into the room , his hat upon his head and a huge <unk> <unk> <unk> like an umbrella under his arm .
&quot; Good gracious , Holmes ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; You don &apos;t mean to say that you have been walking about London with that thing ? &quot;
&quot; I drove to the butcher &apos;s and back . &quot;
&quot; The butcher &apos;s ? &quot;
&quot; And I return with an excellent appetite .
There can be no question , my dear Watson , of the value of exercise before breakfast .
But I am prepared to <unk> that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken . &quot;
&quot; I will not attempt it . &quot;
He chuckled as he poured out the coffee .
&quot; If you could have looked into <unk> &apos;s back shop you would have seen a dead pig swung from a <unk> in the ceiling , and a gentleman in his <unk> furiously stabbing at it with this weapon .
I was that energetic person , and I have satisfied myself that by no <unk> of my strength can I <unk> the pig with a single blow .
Perhaps you would care to try ? &quot;
&quot; Not for <unk> .
But why were you doing this ? &quot;
&quot; Because it seemed to me to have an <unk> bearing upon the mystery of Woodman &apos;s Lee .
Ah , Hopkins , I got your wire last night , and I have been expecting you .
Come and join us . &quot;
Our visitor was an exceedingly alert man , thirty years of age , dressed in a quiet tweed suit , but <unk> the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform .
I recognised him at once as Stanley Hopkins , a young police inspector for whose future Holmes had high hopes , while he in turn <unk> the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur .
Hopkins &apos;s brow was <unk> , and he sat down with an air of deep <unk> .
&quot; No , thank you , sir .
I breakfasted before I came round .
I spent the night in town , for I came up yesterday to report . &quot;
&quot; And what had you to report ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , sir ; absolute failure . &quot;
&quot; You have made no progress ? &quot;
&quot; None . &quot;
&quot; Dear me !
I must have a look at the matter . &quot;
&quot; I wish to heavens that you would , Mr. Holmes .
It &apos;s my first big chance , and I am at my wit &apos;s end .
For goodness &apos; sake come down and lend me a hand . &quot;
&quot; Well , well , it just happens that I have already read all the <unk> evidence , <unk> the report of the inquest , with some care .
By the way , what do you make of that tobaccopouch found on the scene of the crime ?
Is there no clue there ? &quot;
Hopkins looked surprised .
&quot; It was the man &apos;s own pouch , sir .
His initials were inside it .
And it was of <unk> he an old sealer . &quot;
&quot; But he had no pipe . &quot;
&quot; No , sir , we could find no pipe ; indeed , he smoked very little .
And yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends . &quot;
&quot; No doubt .
I only mention it because if I had been handling the case I should have been inclined to make that the startingpoint of my investigation .
However , my friend Dr. Watson knows nothing of this matter , and I should be none the worse for <unk> the sequence of events once more .
Just give us some short <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket .
&quot; I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man , Captain Peter Carey .
He was born in &apos; <unk> years of age .
He was a most <unk> and successful seal and <unk> <unk> .
In 1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn , of Dundee .
He had then had several successful voyages in succession , and in the following year , 1884 , he retired .
After that he travelled for some years , and finally he bought a small place called Woodman &apos;s Lee , near Forest Row , in Sussex .
There he has lived for six years , and there he died just a week ago today .
&quot; There were some most singular points about the man .
In ordinary life he was a strict <unk> silent , gloomy fellow .
His household consisted of his wife , his daughter , aged twenty , and two <unk> servants .
These last were continually <unk> , for it was never a very <unk> situation , and sometimes it became past all bearing .
The man was an <unk> drunkard , and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend .
He has been known to drive his wife and his daughter out of doors in the middle of the night , and <unk> them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams .
&quot; He was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar , who had called upon him to <unk> with him upon his conduct .
In short , Mr. Holmes , you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than Peter Carey , and I have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship .
He was known in the trade as Black Peter , and the name was given him , not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard , but for the <unk> which were the terror of all around him .
I need not say that he was <unk> and <unk> by every one of his neighbours , and that I have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end .
&quot; You must have read in the account of the inquest about the man &apos;s cabin , Mr. Holmes ; but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it .
He had <unk> himself a wooden <unk> always called it &apos; the cabin &apos;a few hundred yards from his house , and it was here that he slept every night .
It was a little , <unk> hut , sixteen feet by ten .
He kept the key in his pocket , made his own bed , <unk> it himself , and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold .
There are small windows on each side , which were covered by curtains and never opened .
One of these windows was turned towards the high road , and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what Black Peter was doing in there .
That &apos;s the window , Mr. Holmes , which gave us one of the few <unk> of positive evidence that came out at the inquest .
&quot; You remember that a <unk> , named <unk> , walking from Forest Row about one o &apos;clock in the <unk> days before the <unk> as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees .
He <unk> that the shadow of a man &apos;s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind , and that this shadow was certainly not that of Peter Carey , whom he knew well .
It was that of a bearded man , but the beard was short and bristled forwards in a way very different from that of the captain .
So he says , but he had been two hours in the publichouse , and it is some distance from the road to the window .
Besides , this <unk> to the Monday , and the crime was done upon the <unk> .
&quot; On the Tuesday Peter Carey was in one of his blackest <unk> , flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast .
He <unk> about the house , and the women ran for it when they heard him coming .
Late in the evening he went down to his own hut .
About two o &apos;clock the following morning his daughter , who slept with her window open , heard a most fearful yell from that direction , but it was no unusual thing for him to <unk> and shout when he was in drink , so no notice was taken .
On rising at seven one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open , but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him .
<unk> into the open door they saw a sight which sent them flying with white faces into the village .
Within an hour I was on the spot and had taken over the case .
&quot; Well , I have fairly steady nerves , as you know , Mr. Holmes , but I give you my word that I got a shake when I put my head into that little house .
It was droning like a <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> , and the floor and walls were like a <unk> .
He had called it a cabin , and a cabin it was sure enough , for you would have thought that you were in a ship .
There was a <unk> at one end , a seachest , <unk> and <unk> , a picture of the Sea Unicorn , a line of logbooks on a shelf , all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain &apos;s room .
And there in the middle of it was the man himself , his face twisted like a lost soul in <unk> , and his great <unk> beard <unk> upwards in his agony .
Right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven , and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him .
He was pinned like a beetle on a card .
Of course , he was quite dead , and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony .
&quot; I know your methods , sir , and I applied them .
Before I permitted anything to be moved I examined most carefully the ground outside , and also the floor of the room .
There were no footmarks . &quot;
&quot; <unk> that you saw none ? &quot;
&quot; I assure you , sir , that there were none . &quot;
&quot; My good Hopkins , I have <unk> many crimes , but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature .
As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some <unk> , some <unk> , some trifling <unk> which can be detected by the scientific <unk> .
It is incredible that this <unk> room contained no trace which could have aided us .
I understand , however , from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to <unk> ? &quot;
The young inspector winced at my companion &apos;s ironical <unk> .
&quot; I was a fool not to call you in at the time , Mr. Holmes .
However , that &apos;s past <unk> for now .
Yes , there were several objects in the room which called for special attention .
One was the harpoon with which the deed was committed .
It had been snatched down from a rack on the wall .
Two others remained there , and there was a vacant place for the third .
On the stock was <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> Sea Unicorn , Dundee . &apos;
This seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury , and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way .
The fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning , and yet Peter Carey was fully dressed , suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer , which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two <unk> glasses stood upon the table . &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; said Holmes ; &quot; I think that both inferences are <unk> .
Was there any other spirit but rum in the room ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; there was a <unk> containing brandy and whisky on the seachest .
It is of no importance to us , however , since the <unk> were full , and it had therefore not been used . &quot;
&quot; For all that its presence has some <unk> , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; However , let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case . &quot;
&quot; There was this tobaccopouch upon the table . &quot;
&quot; What part of the table ? &quot;
&quot; It lay in the middle .
It was of coarse <unk> <unk> skin , with a leather <unk> to <unk> it .
Inside was &apos; P.C . &apos;
on the <unk> .
There was half an ounce of strong ship &apos;s tobacco in it . &quot;
&quot; Excellent !
What more ? &quot;
Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a <unk> notebook .
The outside was rough and worn , the leaves discoloured .
On the first page were written the initials &quot; <unk> &quot;
and the date &quot; 1883 . &quot;
Holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way , while Hopkins and I gazed over each shoulder .
On the second page were the printed letters &quot; <unk> , &quot; and then came several sheets of numbers .
Another heading was <unk> , another <unk> <unk> , and another <unk> <unk> , each with pages of signs and figures after it .
&quot; What do you make of these ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange securities .
I thought that &apos; J.H.N . &apos;
were the initials of a broker , and that &apos; <unk> . &apos;
may have been his client . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; said Holmes .
Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth and struck his <unk> with his clenched hand .
&quot; What a fool I have been ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; Of course , it is as you say .
Then &apos; J.H.N . &apos;
are the only initials we have to solve .
I have already examined the old Stock Exchange lists , and I can find no one in 1883 either in the House or among the outside <unk> whose initials correspond with these .
Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold .
You will admit , Mr. Holmes , that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was <unk> other words , of the murderer .
I would also urge that the <unk> into the case of a document <unk> to large <unk> of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes &apos;s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development .
&quot; I must admit both your points , &quot; said he .
&quot; I confess that this notebook , which did not appear at the inquest , <unk> any <unk> which I may have formed .
I had come to a theory of the crime in which I can find no place for this .
Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned ? &quot;
&quot; Inquiries are now being made at the <unk> , but I fear that the complete register of the <unk> of these South American concerns is in South America , and that some weeks must <unk> before we can trace the shares . &quot;
Holmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying lens .
&quot; Surely there is some discolouration here , &quot; said he .
&quot; Yes , sir , it is a bloodstain .
I told you that I picked the book off the floor . &quot;
&quot; Was the bloodstain above or below ? &quot;
&quot; On the side next the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Which proves , of course , that the book was dropped after the crime was committed . &quot;
&quot; Exactly , Mr. Holmes .
I <unk> that point , and I conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight .
It lay near the door . &quot;
&quot; I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; Have you any reason to suspect robbery ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir .
Nothing seemed to have been touched . &quot;
&quot; Dear me , it is certainly a very interesting case .
Then there was a knife , was there not ? &quot;
&quot; A <unk> , still in its sheath .
It lay at the feet of the dead man .
Mrs. Carey has identified it as being her husband &apos;s property . &quot;
Holmes was lost in thought for some time .
&quot; Well , &quot; said he , at last , &quot; I suppose I shall have to come out and have a look at it . &quot;
Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy .
&quot; Thank you , sir .
That will indeed be a weight off my mind . &quot;
Holmes shook his finger at the inspector .
&quot; It would have been an easier task a week ago , &quot; said he .
&quot; But even now my visit may not be entirely <unk> .
Watson , if you can spare the time I should be very glad of your company .
If you will call a fourwheeler , Hopkins , we shall be ready to start for Forest Row in a quarter of an hour . &quot;
<unk> at the small <unk> station , we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods , which were once part of that great <unk> which for so long held the <unk> <unk> at <unk> impenetrable &quot; <unk> , &quot; for sixty years the <unk> of Britain .
<unk> sections of it have been cleared , for this is the seat of the first <unk> of the country , and the trees have been felled to <unk> the <unk> . Now the <unk> fields of the North have absorbed the trade , and nothing save these <unk> <unk> and great <unk> in the earth show the work of the past .
Here in a clearing upon the green <unk> of a hill stood a long , low stone house , approached by a <unk> drive running through the fields .
<unk> the road , and surrounded on three sides by bushes , was a small outhouse , one window and the door facing in our direction .
It was the scene of the murder .
Stanley Hopkins led us first to the house , where he introduced us to a haggard , <unk> woman , the widow of the murdered man , whose gaunt and deeplined face , with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her <unk> eyes , told of the years of <unk> and <unk> which she had <unk> .
With her was her daughter , a pale , <unk> girl , whose eyes <unk> <unk> at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead , and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down .
It was a terrible household that Black Peter Carey had made for himself , and it was with a sense of <unk> that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man .
The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings , <unk> , <unk> , one window beside the door and one on the farther side .
Stanley Hopkins drew the key from his pocket , and had stooped to the lock , when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face .
&quot; Someone has been <unk> with it , &quot; he said .
There could be no doubt of the fact .
The woodwork was cut and the scratches showed white through the <unk> , as if they had been that instant done .
Holmes had been examining the window .
&quot; Someone has tried to force this also .
<unk> it was has failed to make his way in .
He must have been a very poor burglar . &quot;
&quot; This is a most extraordinary thing , &quot; said the inspector ; &quot; I could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; Some curious person from the village , perhaps , &quot; I suggested .
&quot; Very unlikely .
<unk> of them would dare to set foot in the grounds , far less try to force their way into the cabin .
What do you think of it , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; I think that fortune is very kind to us . &quot;
&quot; You mean that the person will come again ? &quot;
&quot; It is very probable .
He came expecting to find the door open .
He tried to get in with the blade of a very small <unk> .
He could not manage it .
What would he do ? &quot;
&quot; Come again next night with a more useful tool . &quot;
&quot; So I should say .
It will be our fault if we are not there to receive him .
Meanwhile , let me see the inside of the cabin . &quot;
The traces of the tragedy had been removed , but the furniture within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime .
For two hours , with most intense concentration , Holmes examined every object in turn , but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one .
Once only he paused in his patient investigation .
&quot; Have you taken anything off this shelf , Hopkins ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I have moved nothing . &quot;
&quot; Something has been taken .
There is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere .
It may have been a book lying on its side .
It may have been a box .
Well , well , I can do nothing more .
Let us walk in these beautiful woods , Watson , and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers .
We shall meet you here later , Hopkins , and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night . &quot;
It was past eleven o &apos;clock when we formed our little <unk> .
Hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open , but Holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger .
The lock was a perfectly simple one , and only a strong blade was needed to push it back .
Holmes also suggested that we should wait , not inside the hut , but outside it among the bushes which grew round the farther window .
In this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light , and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit .
It was a long and melancholy vigil , and yet brought with it something of the thrill which the <unk> <unk> when he lies beside the water pool and waits for the coming of the <unk> beast of <unk> .
What savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness ?
Was it a fierce tiger of crime , which could only be taken <unk> hard with flashing <unk> and <unk> , or would it prove to be some skulking <unk> , dangerous only to the weak and unguarded ?
In absolute silence we crouched <unk> the bushes , waiting for whatever might come .
At first the steps of a few belated <unk> , or the sound of voices from the village , <unk> our vigil ; but one by one these <unk> died away and an absolute <unk> fell upon us , save for the <unk> of the distant church , which told us of the progress of the night , and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the <unk> which <unk> us in .
Halfpast two had <unk> , and it was the <unk> hour which <unk> the dawn , when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate .
Someone had entered the drive .
Again there was a long silence , and I had begun to fear that it was a false alarm , when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut , and a moment later a metallic <unk> and <unk> .
The man was trying to force the lock !
This time his skill was greater or his tool was better , for there was a sudden <unk> and the creak of the <unk> .
Then a match was struck , and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut .
Through the <unk> curtain our eyes were all <unk> upon the scene within .
The nocturnal visitor was a young man , frail and thin , with a black moustache which <unk> the deadly pallor of his face .
He could not have been much above twenty years of age .
I have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable <unk> , for his teeth were <unk> <unk> and he was shaking in every <unk> .
He was dressed like a gentleman , in Norfolk jacket and <unk> , with a cloth cap upon his head .
We watched him staring round with frightened eyes .
Then he laid the <unk> upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners .
He returned with a large book , one of the logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves .
<unk> on the table he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought .
Then , with an angry gesture of his clenched hand , he closed the book , replaced it in the corner , and put out the light .
He had hardly turned to leave the hut when Hopkins &apos;s hand was on the fellow &apos;s collar , and I heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken .
The candle was <unk> , and there was our wretched captive shivering and <unk> in the grasp of the detective .
He sank down upon the seachest , and looked <unk> from one of us to the other .
&quot; Now , my fine fellow , &quot; said Stanley Hopkins , &quot; who are you , and what do you want here ? &quot;
The man pulled himself together and faced us with an effort at <unk> .
&quot; You are detectives , I suppose ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; You imagine I am connected with the death of Captain Peter Carey .
I assure you that I am innocent . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll see about that , &quot; said Hopkins .
&quot; First of all , what is your name ? &quot;
&quot; It is John <unk> Neligan . &quot;
I saw Holmes and Hopkins <unk> a quick glance .
&quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
&quot; Can I speak confidentially ? &quot;
&quot; No , certainly not . &quot;
&quot; Why should I tell you ? &quot;
&quot; If you have no answer it may go badly with you at the trial . &quot;
The young man winced .
&quot; Well , I will tell you , &quot; he said .
&quot; Why should I not ?
And yet I <unk> to think of this old scandal <unk> a new <unk> of life .
Did you ever hear of Dawson and Neligan ? &quot;
I could see from Hopkins &apos;s face that he never had ; but Holmes was keenly interested .
&quot; You mean the <unk> <unk> , &quot; said he .
&quot; They failed for a <unk> , ruined half the county families of <unk> , and Neligan disappeared . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
Neligan was my father . &quot;
At last we were getting something positive , and yet it seemed a long gap between an <unk> banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against the wall with one of his own <unk> .
We all listened intently to the young man &apos;s words .
&quot; It was my father who was really concerned .
Dawson had retired .
I was only ten years of age at the time , but I was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all .
It has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled .
It is not true .
It was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them all would be well and every <unk> paid in full .
He started in his little yacht for Norway just before the warrant was issued for his arrest .
I can remember that last night when he bade <unk> to my mother .
He left us a list of the securities he was taking , and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared , and that none who had trusted him would suffer .
Well , no word was ever heard from him again .
Both the yacht and he vanished utterly .
We believed , my mother and I , that he and it , with the securities that he had taken with him , were at the bottom of the sea .
We had a <unk> friend , however , who is a business man , and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him have reappeared on the London market .
You can imagine our amazement .
I spent months in trying to trace them , and at last , after many <unk> and difficulties , I discovered that the original <unk> had been Captain Peter Carey , the owner of this hut .
&quot; <unk> , I made some inquiries about the man .
I found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic <unk> at the very time when my father was <unk> to Norway .
The autumn of that year was a <unk> one , and there was a long succession of southerly <unk> .
My father &apos;s yacht may well have been blown to the north , and there met by Captain Peter Carey &apos;s ship .
If that were so , what had become of my father ?
In any case , if I could prove from Peter Carey &apos;s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them , and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them .
&quot; I came down to Sussex with the intention of seeing the captain , but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred .
I read at the inquest a description of his cabin , in which it stated that the old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it .
It struck me that if I could see what occurred in the month of August , 1883 , on board the Sea Unicorn , I might settle the mystery of my father &apos;s fate .
I tried last night to get at these logbooks , but was unable to open the door .
<unk> I tried again , and succeeded ; but I find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book .
It was at that moment I found myself a prisoner in your hands . &quot;
&quot; Is that all ? &quot;
asked Hopkins .
&quot; Yes , that is all . &quot;
His eyes shifted as he said it .
&quot; You have nothing else to tell us ? &quot;
He hesitated .
&quot; No ; there is nothing . &quot;
&quot; You have not been here before last night ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Then how do you account for that ? &quot;
cried Hopkins , as he held up the damning notebook , with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the bloodstain on the cover .
The wretched man collapsed .
He sank his face in his hands and <unk> all over .
&quot; Where did you get it ? &quot;
he groaned .
&quot; I did not know .
I thought I had lost it at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; That is enough , &quot; said Hopkins , sternly .
&quot; Whatever else you have to say you must say in court .
You will walk down with me now to the policestation .
Well , Mr. Holmes , I am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me .
As it turns out your presence was unnecessary , and I would have brought the case to this successful issue without you ; but none the less I am very <unk> .
<unk> have been reserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel , so we can all walk down to the village together . &quot;
&quot; Well , Watson , what do you think of it ? &quot;
asked Holmes , as we travelled back next morning .
&quot; I can see that you are not satisfied . &quot;
&quot; Oh , yes , my dear Watson , I am perfectly satisfied .
At the same time Stanley Hopkins &apos;s methods do not commend themselves to me .
I am disappointed in Stanley Hopkins .
I had hoped for better things from him .
One should always look for a possible alternative and <unk> against it .
It is the first rule of criminal investigation . &quot;
&quot; What , then , is the alternative ? &quot;
&quot; The line of investigation which I have myself been pursuing .
It may give us nothing .
I cannot tell .
But at least I shall follow it to the end . &quot;
Several letters were waiting for Holmes at Baker Street .
He snatched one of them up , opened it , and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter .
&quot; Excellent , Watson .
The alternative <unk> .
Have you telegraph forms ?
Just write a couple of messages for me : &apos; <unk> , <unk> Agent , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> three men on , to arrive ten tomorrow <unk> . &apos;
That &apos;s my name in those parts .
The other is : &apos; Inspector Stanley Hopkins , <unk> , Lord Street , Brixton .
Come breakfast tomorrow at ninethirty .
Important .
<unk> if unable to <unk> Holmes . &apos;
There , Watson , this infernal case has haunted me for ten days .
I <unk> <unk> it completely from my presence .
Tomorrow I trust that we shall hear the last of it for ever . &quot;
<unk> at the hour named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared , and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared .
The young detective was in high spirits at his success .
&quot; You really think that your solution must be correct ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; I could not imagine a more complete case . &quot;
&quot; It did not seem to me <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You <unk> me , Mr. Holmes .
What more could one ask for ? &quot;
&quot; Does your explanation cover every point ? &quot;
&quot; Undoubtedly .
I find that young Neligan arrived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of the crime .
He came on the <unk> of playing <unk> .
His room was on the <unk> , and he could get out when he liked .
That very night he went down to Woodman &apos;s Lee , saw Peter Carey at the hut , <unk> with him , and killed him with the harpoon .
Then , horrified by what he had done , he fled out of the hut , <unk> the notebook which he had brought with him in order to question Peter Carey about these different securities .
You may have observed that some of them were marked with <unk> , and the <unk> great <unk> not .
Those which are <unk> have been traced on the London market ; but the others <unk> were still in the possession of Carey , and young Neligan , <unk> to his own account , was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father &apos;s creditors .
After his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time ; but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed .
Surely that is all simple and obvious ? &quot;
Holmes smiled and shook his head .
&quot; It seems to me to have only one <unk> , Hopkins , and that is that it is <unk> impossible .
Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body ?
No ?
Tut , tut , my dear sir , you must really pay attention to these details .
My friend Watson could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise .
It is no easy matter , and <unk> a strong and <unk> arm .
But this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall .
Do you imagine that this <unk> youth was capable of so frightful an assault ?
Is he the man who <unk> in rum and water with Black Peter in the dead of the night ?
Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before ?
No , no , Hopkins ; it is another and a more formidable person for whom we must seek . &quot;
The detective &apos;s face had <unk> longer and longer during Holmes &apos;s speech .
His hopes and his <unk> were all <unk> about him .
But he would not abandon his position without a struggle .
&quot; You can &apos;t deny that Neligan was present that night , Mr. Holmes .
The book will prove that .
I fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a jury , even if you are able to pick a hole in it .
Besides , Mr. Holmes , I have laid my hand upon my man .
As to this terrible person of yours , where is he ? &quot;
&quot; I rather fancy that he is on the stair , &quot; said Holmes , <unk> .
&quot; I think , Watson , that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it . &quot;
He rose , and laid a written paper upon a sidetable .
&quot; Now we are ready , &quot; said he .
There had been some talking in gruff voices outside , and now Mrs. Hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for Captain Basil .
&quot; <unk> them in one by one , &quot; said Holmes .
The first who entered was a little <unk> of a man , with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white sidewhiskers .
Holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket .
&quot; What name ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; James Lancaster . &quot;
&quot; I am sorry , Lancaster , but the <unk> is full .
Here is half a sovereign for your trouble .
Just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes . &quot;
The second man was a long , <unk> creature , with lank hair and sallow cheeks .
His name was <unk> <unk> .
He also received his <unk> , his <unk> , and the order to wait .
The third <unk> was a man of remarkable appearance .
A fierce bulldog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard , and two bold dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick , tufted , overhung eyebrows .
He <unk> and stood <unk> , turning his cap round in his hands .
&quot; Your name ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; Patrick Cairns . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
<unk> voyages . &quot;
&quot; Dundee , I suppose ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; And ready to start with an <unk> ship ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; What wages ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> pounds a month . &quot;
&quot; Could you start at once ? &quot;
&quot; As soon as I get my kit . &quot;
&quot; Have you your papers ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
He took a sheaf of worn and <unk> forms from his pocket .
Holmes glanced over them and returned them .
&quot; You are just the man I want , &quot; said he .
&quot; Here &apos;s the agreement on the sidetable .
If you sign it the whole matter will be settled . &quot;
The seaman <unk> across the room and took up the pen .
&quot; Shall I sign here ? &quot;
he asked , stooping over the table .
Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck .
&quot; This will do , &quot; said he .
I heard a click of steel and a <unk> like an <unk> bull .
The next instant Holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together .
He was a man of such <unk> strength that , even with the handcuffs which Holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists , he would have very quickly <unk> my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed to his <unk> .
Only when I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his <unk> did he at last understand that resistance was vain .
We lashed his <unk> with cord and rose <unk> from the struggle .
&quot; I must really apologize , Hopkins , &quot; said Sherlock Holmes ; &quot; I fear that the scrambled <unk> are cold .
However , you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better , will you not , for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion . &quot;
Stanley Hopkins was <unk> with amazement .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what to say , Mr. Holmes , &quot; he <unk> out at last , with a very red face .
&quot; It seems to me that I have been making a fool of myself from the beginning .
I understand now , what I should never have forgotten , that I am the pupil and you are the master .
Even now I see what you have done , but I don &apos;t know how you did it , or what it <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Well , well , &quot; said Holmes , goodhumouredly .
&quot; We all learn by experience , and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative .
You were so absorbed in young Neligan that you could not spare a thought to Patrick Cairns , the true murderer of Peter Carey . &quot;
The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation .
&quot; See here , mister , &quot; said he , &quot; I make no complaint of being <unk> in this fashion , but I would have you call things by their right names .
You say I murdered Peter Carey ; I say I killed Peter Carey , and there &apos;s all the difference .
Maybe you don &apos;t believe what I say .
Maybe you think I am just <unk> you a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Not at all , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Let us hear what you have to say . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s soon told , and , by the Lord , every word of it is truth .
I knew Black Peter , and when he pulled out his knife I <unk> a harpoon through him sharp , for I knew that it was him or me .
That &apos;s how he died .
You can call it murder .
Anyhow , I &apos;d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with Black Peter &apos;s knife in my heart . &quot;
&quot; How came you there ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; I &apos;ll tell it you from the beginning .
Just sit me up a little so as I can speak easy .
It was in &apos; <unk> that it <unk> of that year .
Peter Carey was master of the Sea Unicorn , and I was spare <unk> .
We were coming out of the <unk> on our way home , with head <unk> and a week &apos;s southerly gale , when we picked up a little <unk> that had been blown north .
There was one man on <unk> <unk> .
The crew had thought she would founder , and had made for the Norwegian coast in the <unk> .
I guess they were all <unk> .
Well , we took him on board , this man , and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin .
All the <unk> we took off with him was one tin box .
So far as I know , the man &apos;s name was never mentioned , and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been .
It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having .
Only one man knew what had happened to him , and that was me , for with my own eyes I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the <unk> in the middle watch of a dark night , two days before we <unk> the <unk> lights .
&quot; Well , I kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see what would come of it .
When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up , and nobody asked any questions .
A stranger died by an accident , and it was nobody &apos;s business to inquire .
<unk> after Peter Carey gave up the sea , and it was long years before I could find where he was .
I guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box , and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut .
&quot; I found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in London , and down I went to squeeze him .
The first night he was reasonable enough , and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life .
We were to fix it all two nights later .
When I came I found him three parts drunk and in a <unk> temper .
We sat down and we drank and we <unk> about old times , but the more he drank the less I liked the look on his face .
I spotted that harpoon upon the wall , and I thought I might need it before I was through .
Then at last he broke out at me , <unk> and cursing , with murder in his eyes and a great <unk> in his hand .
He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon through him .
Heavens !
what a yell he gave ; and his face gets between me and my sleep !
I stood there , with his blood splashing round me , and I waited for a bit ; but all was quiet , so I took heart once more .
I looked round , and there was the tin box on a shelf .
I had as much right to it as Peter Carey , anyhow , so I took it with me and left the hut .
<unk> a fool I left my <unk> upon the table .
&quot; Now I &apos;ll tell you the <unk> part of the whole story .
I had hardly got outside the hut when I heard someone coming , and I hid among the bushes .
A man came slinking along , went into the hut , gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost , and <unk> it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight .
Who he was or what he wanted is more than I can tell .
For my part I walked ten miles , got a train at <unk> <unk> , and so reached London , and no one the wiser .
&quot; Well , when I came to examine the box I found there was no money in it , and nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell .
I had lost my hold on Black Peter , and was stranded in London without a shilling .
There was only my trade left .
I saw these <unk> about harpooners and high wages , so I went to the shipping agents , and they sent me here .
That &apos;s all I know , and I say again that if I killed Black Peter the law should give me thanks , for I saved them the price of a <unk> rope . &quot;
&quot; A very clear statement , &quot; said Holmes , rising and lighting his pipe .
&quot; I think , Hopkins , that you should lose no time in <unk> your prisoner to a place of safety .
This room is not well adapted for a cell , and Mr. Patrick Cairns <unk> too large a <unk> of our carpet . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Holmes , &quot; said Hopkins , &quot; I do not know how to express my <unk> .
Even now I do not understand how you attained this result . &quot;
&quot; <unk> by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning .
It is very possible if I had known about this notebook it might have led away my thoughts , as it did yours .
But all I heard pointed in the one direction .
The amazing strength , the skill in the use of the harpoon , the rum and water , the <unk> tobaccopouch , with the coarse tobaccoall these pointed to a seaman , and one who had been a whaler .
I was convinced that the initials &apos; P.C . &apos;
upon the pouch were a coincidence , and not those of Peter Carey , since he seldom smoked , and no pipe was found in his cabin .
You remember that I asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin .
You said they were .
How many <unk> are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits ?
Yes , I was certain it was a seaman . &quot;
&quot; And how did you find him ? &quot;
&quot; My dear sir , the problem had become a very simple one .
If it were a seaman , it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the Sea Unicorn .
So far as I could learn he had <unk> in no other ship .
I spent three days in <unk> to Dundee , and at the end of that time I had ascertained the names of the crew of the Sea Unicorn in 1883 .
When I found Patrick Cairns among the harpooners my research was <unk> its end .
I <unk> that the man was probably in London , and that he would desire to leave the country for a time .
I therefore spent some days in the <unk> , <unk> an Arctic expedition , put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under Captain <unk> <unk> the result ! &quot;
&quot; Wonderful ! &quot;
cried Hopkins .
&quot; Wonderful ! &quot;
&quot; You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I confess that I think you owe him some apology .
The tin box must be returned to him , but , of course , the securities which Peter Carey has sold are lost for ever .
There &apos;s the cab , Hopkins , and you can remove your man .
If you want me for the trial , my address and that of Watson will be somewhere in <unk> &apos;ll send particulars later . &quot;
It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place , and yet it is with <unk> that I allude to them .
For a long time , even with the utmost discretion and reticence , it would have been impossible to make the facts public ; but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law , and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to <unk> no one .
It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself .
The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence .
We had been out for one of our evening <unk> , Holmes and I , and had returned about six o &apos;clock on a cold , frosty winter &apos;s evening .
As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table .
He glanced at it , and then , with an ejaculation of disgust , threw it on the floor .
I picked it up and read : Charles Augustus Milverton , Appledore Towers , Hampstead .
Agent .
&quot; Who is he ? &quot;
I asked .
&quot; The worst man in London , &quot; Holmes answered , as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire .
&quot; Is anything on the back of the card ? &quot;
I turned it over .
&quot; Will call at <unk> , &quot; I read .
&quot; Hum !
He &apos;s about due .
Do you feel a creeping , shrinking sensation , Watson , when you stand before the <unk> in the <unk> and see the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with their deadly eyes and wicked , flattened faces ?
Well , that &apos;s how Milverton <unk> me .
I &apos;ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career , but the worst of them never gave me the <unk> which I have for this fellow .
And yet I can &apos;t get out of doing business with <unk> , he is here at my invitation . &quot;
&quot; But who is he ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you , Watson .
He is the <unk> of all the <unk> .
Heaven help the man , and still more the woman , whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton .
With a smiling face and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has <unk> them dry .
The fellow is a genius in his way , and would have made his mark in some more <unk> trade .
His method is as follows : He <unk> it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high <unk> for letters which compromise people of wealth or position .
He receives these <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> or maids , but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained the confidence and <unk> of <unk> women .
He deals with no <unk> hand .
I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length , and that the ruin of a noble family was the result .
Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton , and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name .
No one knows where his grip may fall , for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth .
He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth <unk> .
I have said that he is the worst man in London , and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood <unk> his <unk> with this man , who <unk> and at his leisure <unk> the soul and <unk> the nerves in order to add to his already <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling .
&quot; But surely , &quot; said I , &quot; the fellow must be within the grasp of the law ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , no doubt , but practically not .
What would it profit a woman , for example , to get him a few months &apos; imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow ?
His <unk> dare not hit back .
If ever he <unk> an innocent person , then , indeed , we should have him ; but he is as cunning as the <unk> One .
No , no ; we must find other ways to fight him . &quot;
&quot; And why is he here ? &quot;
&quot; Because an illustrious client has placed her <unk> case in my hands .
It is the Lady Eva <unk> , the most beautiful <unk> of last <unk> .
She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt .
This fiend has several <unk> <unk> , Watson , nothing <unk> were written to an <unk> young squire in the country .
They would suffice to break off the match .
Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him .
I have been commissioned to meet him , <unk> make the best terms I can . &quot;
At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below .
Looking down I saw a stately carriage and pair , the brilliant lamps gleaming on the <unk> <unk> of the noble <unk> .
A footman opened the door , and a small , stout man in a shaggy astrachan overcoat descended .
A minute later he was in the room .
Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty , with a large , <unk> head , a round , plump , hairless face , a <unk> frozen smile , and two keen grey eyes , which gleamed <unk> from behind broad , <unk> glasses .
There was something of Mr. <unk> &apos;s <unk> in his appearance , <unk> only by the <unk> of the fixed smile and by the hard <unk> of those restless and penetrating eyes .
His voice was as smooth and <unk> as his <unk> , as he advanced with a plump little hand extended , <unk> his regret for having missed us at his first visit .
Holmes <unk> the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite .
Milverton &apos;s smile broadened ; he shrugged his shoulders , removed his overcoat , folded it with great <unk> over the back of a chair , and then took a seat .
&quot; This gentleman ? &quot;
said he , with a <unk> in my direction .
&quot; Is it discreet ?
Is it right ? &quot;
&quot; Dr. Watson is my friend and partner . &quot;
&quot; Very good , Mr. Holmes .
It is only in your client &apos;s interests that I <unk> .
The matter is so very delicate &quot; &quot; Dr. Watson has already heard of it . &quot;
&quot; Then we can proceed to business .
You say that you are acting for Lady Eva .
Has she <unk> you to accept my terms ? &quot;
&quot; What are your terms ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> thousand pounds . &quot;
&quot; And the alternative ? &quot;
&quot; My dear sir , it is painful for me to discuss it ; but if the money is not paid on the <unk> there certainly will be no marriage on the <unk> . &quot;
His <unk> smile was more <unk> than ever .
Holmes thought for a little .
&quot; You appear to me , &quot; he said , at last , &quot; to be taking matters too much for granted .
I am , of course , familiar with the contents of these letters .
My client will certainly do what I may <unk> .
I shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his <unk> . &quot;
Milverton chuckled .
&quot; You evidently do not know the Earl , &quot; said he .
From the <unk> look upon Holmes &apos;s face I could see clearly that he did .
&quot; What harm is there in the letters ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; They are <unk> <unk> , &quot; Milverton answered .
&quot; The lady was a charming correspondent .
But I can assure you that the Earl of Dovercourt would fail to appreciate them .
However , since you think otherwise , we will let it rest at that .
It is purely a matter of business .
If you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl , then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them . &quot;
He rose and seized his astrachan coat .
Holmes was grey with anger and <unk> .
&quot; Wait a little , &quot; he said .
&quot; You go too fast .
We would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter . &quot;
Milverton <unk> into his chair .
&quot; I was sure that you would see it in that light , &quot; he <unk> .
&quot; At the same time , &quot; Holmes continued , &quot; Lady Eva is not a wealthy woman .
I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources , and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power .
I beg , therefore , that you will <unk> your demands , and that you will return the letters at the price I indicate , which is , I assure you , the highest that you can get . &quot;
Milverton &apos;s smile broadened and his eyes <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I am aware that what you say is true about the lady &apos;s resources , &quot; said he .
&quot; At the same time , you must admit that the occasion of a lady &apos;s marriage is a very <unk> time for her friends and <unk> to make some little effort upon her <unk> .
They may hesitate as to an <unk> wedding present .
Let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the <unk> and <unk> in London . &quot;
&quot; It is impossible , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Dear me , dear me , how unfortunate ! &quot;
cried Milverton , taking out a bulky pocketbook .
&quot; I cannot help thinking that ladies are <unk> in not making an effort .
Look at this ! &quot;
He held up a little note with a coatofarms upon the envelope .
&quot; That belongs <unk> , perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until tomorrow morning .
But at that time it will be in the hands of the lady &apos;s husband .
And all because she will not find a <unk> sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into <unk> .
It is such a pity .
Now , you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel <unk> ?
Only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the <unk> <unk> to say that it was all off .
And why ?
It is almost incredible , but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question .
Is it not <unk> ?
And here I find you , a man of sense , <unk> about terms when your client &apos;s future and honour are at stake .
You surprise me , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; What I say is true , &quot; Holmes answered .
&quot; The money cannot be found .
Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman &apos;s career , which can profit you in no way ? &quot;
&quot; There you make a mistake , Mr. Holmes .
An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent .
I have eight or ten similar cases <unk> .
If it was <unk> among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason .
You see my point ? &quot;
Holmes sprang from his chair .
&quot; Get behind him , Watson !
Don &apos;t let him out !
Now , sir , let us see the contents of that notebook . &quot;
Milverton had <unk> as quick as a rat to the side of the room , and stood with his back against the wall .
&quot; Mr. Holmes , Mr. Holmes , &quot; he said , turning the front of his coat and <unk> the butt of a large revolver , which projected from the inside pocket .
&quot; I have been expecting you to do something original .
This has been done so often , and what good has ever come from it ?
I assure you that I am armed to the teeth , and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons , knowing that the law will support me .
Besides , your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken .
I would do nothing so foolish .
And now , gentlemen , I have one or two little <unk> this evening , and it is a long drive to Hampstead . &quot;
He stepped forward , took up his coat , laid his hand on his revolver , and turned to the door .
I picked up a chair , but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again .
With <unk> , a smile , and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room , and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away .
Holmes sat motionless by the fire , his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets , his chin sunk upon his breast , his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers .
For half an hour he was silent and still .
Then , with the gesture of a man who has taken his <unk> , he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom .
A little later a <unk> young workman with a <unk> beard and a <unk> lit his clay pipe at the lamp before <unk> into the street .
&quot; I &apos;ll be back some time , Watson , &quot; said he , and vanished into the night .
I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton ; but I little <unk> the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take .
For some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire , but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead , and that it was not wasted , I knew nothing of what he was doing .
At last , however , on a wild , tempestuous evening , when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows , he returned from his last expedition , and having removed his <unk> he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion .
&quot; You would not call me a <unk> man , Watson ? &quot;
&quot; No , indeed ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll be interested to hear that I am engaged . &quot;
&quot; My dear fellow !
I <unk> &quot; &quot; To Milverton &apos;s housemaid . &quot;
&quot; Good heavens , Holmes ! &quot;
&quot; I wanted information , Watson . &quot;
&quot; Surely you have gone too far ? &quot;
&quot; It was a most necessary step .
I am a <unk> with a rising business , <unk> by name .
I have walked out with her each evening , and I have talked with her .
Good heavens , those talks !
However , I have got all I wanted .
I know Milverton &apos;s house as I know the palm of my hand . &quot;
&quot; But the girl , Holmes ? &quot;
He shrugged his shoulders .
&quot; You can &apos;t help it , my dear Watson .
You must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table .
However , I rejoice to say that I have a hated <unk> who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned .
What a splendid night it is ! &quot;
&quot; You like this weather ? &quot;
&quot; It suits my purpose .
Watson , I mean to burgle Milverton &apos;s house tonight . &quot;
I had a <unk> of the breath , and my skin went cold at the words , which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution .
As a flash of <unk> in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wide landscape , so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result of such an <unk> detection , the <unk> , the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and <unk> , my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious Milverton .
&quot; For Heaven &apos;s sake , Holmes , think what you are doing , &quot; I cried .
&quot; My dear fellow , I have given it every consideration .
I am never <unk> in my actions , nor would I <unk> so energetic and indeed so dangerous a course if any other were possible .
Let us look at the matter clearly and fairly .
I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable , though <unk> criminal .
To burgle his house is no more than to <unk> take his <unk> action in which you were prepared to aid me . &quot;
I turned it over in my mind .
&quot; Yes , &quot; I said ; &quot; it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an <unk> purpose . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
Since it is morally justifiable I have only to consider the question of personal risk .
Surely a gentleman should not lay much <unk> upon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help ? &quot;
&quot; You will be in such a false position . &quot;
&quot; Well , that is part of the risk .
There is no other possible way of <unk> these letters .
The unfortunate lady has not the money , and there are none of her people in whom she could confide .
Tomorrow is the last day of <unk> , and unless we can get the letters tonight this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin .
I must , therefore , abandon my client to her fate or I must play this last card .
Between ourselves , Watson , it &apos;s a sporting <unk> between this fellow Milverton and me .
He had , as you saw , the best of the first <unk> ; but my selfrespect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish . &quot;
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t like it ; but I suppose it must be , &quot; said I.
&quot; When do we start ? &quot;
&quot; You are not coming . &quot;
&quot; Then you are not going , &quot; said I.
&quot; I give you my word of <unk> I never broke it in my <unk> I will take a cab straight to the policestation and give you away unless you let me share this adventure with you . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t help me . &quot;
&quot; How do you know that ?
You can &apos;t tell what may happen .
<unk> , my resolution is taken .
Other people beside you have selfrespect and even reputations . &quot;
Holmes had looked <unk> , but his brow cleared , and he clapped me on the shoulder .
&quot; Well , well , my dear fellow , be it so .
We have shared the same room for some years , and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell .
You know , Watson , I don &apos;t mind confessing to you that I have always had an idea that I would have made a highly <unk> criminal .
This is the chance of my lifetime in that direction .
See here ! &quot;
He took a <unk> little leather case out of a drawer , and opening it he <unk> a number of shining instruments .
&quot; This is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> kit , with <unk> jemmy , <unk> <unk> , <unk> keys , and every modern <unk> which the <unk> of <unk> demands .
Here , too , is my dark lantern .
Everything is in order .
Have you a pair of silent shoes ? &quot;
&quot; I have <unk> tennis shoes . &quot;
&quot; Excellent .
And a mask ? &quot;
&quot; I can make a couple out of black silk . &quot;
&quot; I can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing .
Very good ; do you make the masks .
We shall have some cold supper before we start .
It is now ninethirty .
At eleven we shall drive as far as Church Row .
It is a quarter of an hour &apos;s walk from there to Appledore Towers .
We shall be at work before midnight .
Milverton is a heavy sleeper and retires <unk> at <unk> .
With any luck we should be back here by two , with the Lady Eva &apos;s letters in my pocket . &quot;
Holmes and I put on our <unk> , so that we might appear to be two <unk> <unk> bound .
In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in Hampstead .
Here we paid off our cab , and with our <unk> <unk> up , for it was bitterly cold and the wind seemed to blow through us , we walked along the edge of the Heath .
&quot; It &apos;s a business that needs delicate treatment , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; These documents are contained in a safe in the fellow &apos;s study , and the study is the <unk> of his <unk> .
On the other hand , like all these stout , little men who do themselves well , he is a <unk> sleeper .
<unk> &apos;s my <unk> it is a joke in the servants &apos; hall that it &apos;s impossible to <unk> the master .
He has a secretary who is devoted to his interests and never <unk> from the study all day .
That &apos;s why we are going at night .
Then he has a beast of a dog which <unk> the garden .
I met <unk> late the last two evenings , and she <unk> the brute up so as to give me a clear run .
This is the house , this big one in its own grounds .
Through the <unk> to the right among the <unk> .
We might put on our masks here , I think .
You see , there is not a <unk> of light in any of the windows , and everything is working <unk> . &quot;
With our black silk <unk> , which turned us into two of the most <unk> figures in London , we stole up to the silent , gloomy house .
A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it , lined by several windows and two doors .
&quot; That &apos;s his bedroom , &quot; Holmes whispered .
&quot; This door opens straight into the study .
It would suit us best , but it is bolted as well as locked , and we should make too much noise getting in .
Come round here .
There &apos;s a <unk> which opens into the drawingroom . &quot;
The place was locked , but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside .
An instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us , and we had become <unk> in the eyes of the law .
The thick , warm air of the <unk> and the rich , choking <unk> of <unk> <unk> took us by the throat .
He seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past <unk> of <unk> which <unk> against our faces .
Holmes had remarkable powers , carefully <unk> , of seeing in the dark .
Still holding my hand in one of his he opened a door , and I was <unk> conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before .
He felt his way among the furniture , opened another door , and closed it behind us .
<unk> out my hand I felt several coats hanging from the wall , and I understood that I was in a passage .
We passed along it , and Holmes very gently opened a door upon the righthand side .
Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth , but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat .
A fire was burning in this new room , and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke .
Holmes entered on tiptoe , waited for me to follow , and then very gently closed the door .
We were in Milverton &apos;s study , and a <unk> at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom .
It was a good fire , and the room was <unk> by it .
Near the door I saw the gleam of an electric switch , but it was unnecessary , even if it had been safe , to turn it on .
At one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain , which covered the bay window we had seen from outside .
On the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda .
A desk stood in the centre , with a turning chair of shining red leather .
Opposite was a large bookcase , with a marble bust of <unk> on the top .
In the corner between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green safe , the <unk> flashing back from the polished brass <unk> upon its face .
Holmes stole across and looked at it .
Then he crept to the door of the bedroom , and stood with <unk> head <unk> intently .
No sound came from within .
Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be <unk> to secure our retreat through the outer door , so I examined it .
To my amazement it was neither locked nor bolted !
I touched Holmes on the arm , and he turned his masked face in that direction .
I saw him start , and he was evidently as surprised as I.
&quot; I don &apos;t like it , &quot; he whispered , putting his lips to my very ear .
&quot; I can &apos;t quite make it out .
Anyhow , we have no time to lose . &quot;
&quot; Can I do anything ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; stand by the door .
If you hear anyone come , bolt it on the inside , and we can get away as we came .
If they come the other way , we can get through the door if our job is done , or hide behind these window curtains if it is not .
Do you understand ? &quot;
I nodded and stood by the door .
My first feeling of fear had passed away , and I <unk> now with a keener <unk> than I had ever enjoyed when we were the <unk> of the law instead of its <unk> .
The high object of our mission , the consciousness that it was unselfish and <unk> , the <unk> character of our <unk> , all added to the sporting interest of the adventure .
Far from feeling guilty , I rejoiced and <unk> in our dangers .
With a <unk> of admiration I watched Holmes <unk> his case of instruments and <unk> his tool with the calm , scientific <unk> of a surgeon who <unk> a delicate operation .
I knew that the opening of <unk> was a particular hobby with him , and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold <unk> , the <unk> which held in its <unk> the reputations of many fair ladies .
Turning up the <unk> of his <unk> had placed his overcoat on a <unk> laid out two <unk> , a jemmy , and several <unk> keys .
I stood at the centre door with my eyes <unk> at each of the others , ready for any emergency ; though , indeed , my plans were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted .
For half an hour Holmes worked with concentrated energy , laying down one tool , picking up another , handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic .
Finally I heard a click , the broad green door swung open , and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets , each tied , sealed , and inscribed .
Holmes picked one out , but it was hard to read by the <unk> fire , and he drew out his little dark lantern , for it was too dangerous , with Milverton in the next room , to switch on the electric light .
Suddenly I saw him <unk> , listen intently , and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to , picked up his coat , stuffed his <unk> into the pockets , and darted behind the window curtain , <unk> me to do the same .
It was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed his quicker senses .
There was a noise somewhere within the house .
A door <unk> in the distance .
Then a confused , dull <unk> broke itself into the <unk> thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching .
They were in the passage outside the room .
They paused at the door .
The door opened .
There was a sharp <unk> as the electric light was turned on .
The door closed once more , and the <unk> reek of a strong cigar was borne to our <unk> .
Then the footsteps continued backwards and forwards , backwards and forwards , within a few yards of us .
Finally , there was a creak from a chair , and the footsteps ceased .
Then a key <unk> in a lock and I heard the rustle of papers .
So far I had not dared to look out , but now I gently parted the <unk> of the curtains in front of me and <unk> through .
From the pressure of Holmes &apos;s shoulder against mine I knew that he was sharing my observations .
Right in front of us , and almost within our reach , was the broad , rounded back of Milverton .
It was evident that we had entirely <unk> his movements , that he had never been to his bedroom , but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or <unk> room in the farther wing of the house , the windows of which we had not seen .
His broad , grizzled head , with its shining patch of <unk> , was in the immediate <unk> of our vision .
He was leaning far back in the red leather chair , his legs outstretched , a long black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth .
He wore a <unk> smoking jacket , <unk> , with a black <unk> collar .
In his hand he held a long legal document , which he was reading in an <unk> fashion , blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so .
There was no promise of a <unk> departure in his composed bearing and his <unk> attitude .
I felt Holmes &apos;s hand steal into mine and give me a <unk> shake , as if to say that the situation was within his powers and that he was easy in his mind .
I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position , that the door of the safe was <unk> closed , and that Milverton might at any moment observe it .
In my own mind I had determined that if I were sure , from the rigidity of his gaze , that it had caught his eye , I would at once spring out , throw my <unk> over his head , <unk> him , and leave the rest to Holmes .
But Milverton never looked up .
He was languidly interested by the papers in his hand , and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer .
At least , I thought , when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room ; but before he had reached the end of either there came a remarkable development which turned our thoughts into quite another <unk> .
Several times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch , and once he had risen and sat down again , with a gesture of impatience .
The idea , however , that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside .
Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair .
The sound was repeated , and then there came a gentle tap at the door .
Milverton rose and opened it .
&quot; Well , &quot; said he , <unk> , &quot; you are nearly half an hour late . &quot;
So this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton .
There was the gentle rustle of a woman &apos;s dress .
I had closed the <unk> between the curtains as Milverton &apos;s face had turned in our direction , but now I ventured very carefully to open it once more .
He had resumed his seat , the cigar still projecting at an <unk> angle from the corner of his mouth .
In front of him , in the full glare of the electric light , there stood a tall , slim , dark woman , a veil over her face , a mantle drawn round her chin .
Her breath came quick and fast , and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion .
&quot; Well , &quot; said Milverton , &quot; you &apos;ve made me lose a good night &apos;s rest , my dear .
I hope you &apos;ll prove worth it .
You couldn &apos;t come any other <unk> ? &quot;
The woman shook her head .
&quot; Well , if you couldn &apos;t you couldn &apos;t .
If the Countess is a hard mistress you have your chance to get level with her now .
<unk> the girl , what are you shivering about ?
That &apos;s right !
Pull yourself together !
Now , let us get down to business . &quot;
He took a note from the drawer of his desk .
&quot; You say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess <unk> <unk> .
You want to sell them .
I want to buy them .
So far so good .
It only remains to fix a price .
I should want to <unk> the letters , of course .
If they are really good <unk> heavens , is it you ? &quot;
The woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin .
It was a dark , handsome , clearcut face which confronted Milverton , a face with a curved nose , strong , dark eyebrows <unk> hard , glittering eyes , and a straight , <unk> mouth set in a dangerous smile .
&quot; It is I , &quot; she said ; &quot; the woman whose life you have ruined . &quot;
Milverton laughed , but fear vibrated in his voice .
&quot; You were so very obstinate , &quot; said he .
&quot; Why did you drive me to such <unk> ?
I assure you I wouldn &apos;t hurt a fly of my own <unk> , but every man has his business , and what was I to do ?
I put the price well within your means .
You would not pay . &quot;
&quot; So you sent the letters to my husband , and <unk> <unk> gentleman that ever lived , a man whose boots I was never worthy to <unk> broke his <unk> heart and died .
You remember that last night when I came through that door I begged and <unk> you for mercy , and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now , only your <unk> heart cannot keep your lips from twitching ?
Yes , you never thought to see me here again , but it was that night which <unk> me how I could meet you face to face , and alone .
Well , Charles Milverton , what have you to say ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t imagine that you can bully me , &quot; said he , rising to his feet .
&quot; I have only to raise my voice , and I could call my servants and have you arrested .
But I will make <unk> for your natural anger .
<unk> the room at once as you came , and I will say no more . &quot;
The woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom , and the same deadly smile on her thin lips .
&quot; You will ruin no more lives as you ruined mine .
You will <unk> no more <unk> as you wrung mine .
I will free the world of a <unk> thing .
Take that , you hound , and that ! and that ! and that ! &quot;
She had drawn a little , gleaming revolver , and emptied barrel after barrel into Milverton &apos;s body , the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front .
He <unk> away and then fell forward upon the table , <unk> furiously and clawing among the papers .
Then he staggered to his feet , received another shot , and rolled upon the floor .
&quot; You &apos;ve done me , &quot; he cried , and lay still .
The woman looked at him intently and ground her heel into his upturned face .
She looked again , but there was no sound or movement .
I heard a sharp rustle , the night air blew into the <unk> room , and the <unk> was gone .
No interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate ; but as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton &apos;s shrinking body I was about to spring out , when I felt Holmes &apos;s cold , strong grasp upon my wrist .
I understood the whole argument of that firm , <unk> <unk> it was no affair of ours ; that justice had <unk> a villain ; that we had our own duties and our own objects which were not to be lost sight of .
But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when Holmes , with swift , silent steps , was over at the other door .
He turned the key in the lock .
At the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet .
The revolver shots had <unk> the household .
With perfect <unk> Holmes slipped across to the safe , filled his two arms with bundles of letters , and poured them all into the fire .
Again and again he did it , until the safe was empty .
Someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door .
Holmes looked swiftly round .
The letter which had been the messenger of death for Milverton lay , all mottled with his blood , upon the table .
Holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers .
Then he drew the key from the outer door , passed through after me , and locked it on the outside .
&quot; This way , Watson , &quot; said he ; &quot; we can <unk> the garden wall in this direction . &quot;
I could not have believed that an alarm could have <unk> so swiftly .
Looking back , the huge house was one blaze of light .
The front door was open , and figures were rushing down the drive .
The whole garden was alive with people , and one fellow raised a <unk> as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels .
Holmes seemed to know the ground perfectly , and he <unk> his way swiftly among a <unk> of small trees , I close at his heels , and our <unk> pursuer panting behind us .
It was a <unk> wall which barred our path , but he sprang to the top and over .
As I did the same I felt the hand of the man behind me <unk> at my ankle ; but I kicked myself free and scrambled over a <unk> <unk> .
I fell upon my face among some bushes ; but Holmes had me on my feet in an instant , and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of Hampstead Heath .
We had run two miles , I suppose , before Holmes at last halted and listened intently .
All was absolute silence behind us .
We had shaken off our pursuers and were safe .
We had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after the remarkable experience which I have recorded when Mr. Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , very solemn and <unk> , was ushered into our modest sittingroom .
&quot; Good morning , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said he ; &quot; good morning .
May I ask if you are very busy just now ? &quot;
&quot; Not too busy to listen to you . &quot;
&quot; I thought that , perhaps , if you had nothing particular on hand , you might care to <unk> us in a most remarkable case which occurred only last night at Hampstead . &quot;
&quot; Dear me ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; What was that ? &quot;
&quot; A <unk> most dramatic and remarkable murder .
I know how keen you are upon these things , and I would take it as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers and give us the benefit of your advice .
It is no ordinary crime .
We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for some time , and , between ourselves , he was a bit of a villain .
He is known to have held papers which he used for <unk> purposes .
These papers have all been burned by the murderers .
No article of value was taken , as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position , whose sole object was to prevent social exposure . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , there were two of them .
They were , as nearly as possible , captured <unk> .
We have their footmarks , we have their description ; it &apos;s ten to one that we trace them .
The first fellow was a bit too active , but the second was caught by the <unk> and only got away after a struggle .
He was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> jaw , thick neck , moustache , a mask over his eyes . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s rather vague , &quot; said Sherlock Holmes .
&quot; Why , it might be a description of Watson ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s true , &quot; said the inspector , with much amusement .
&quot; It might be a description of Watson . &quot;
&quot; Well , I am afraid I can &apos;t help you , Lestrade , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; The fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton , that I considered him one of the most dangerous men in London , and that I think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch , and which therefore , to some extent , justify private revenge .
No , it &apos;s no use <unk> .
I have made up my mind .
My sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim , and I will not handle this case . &quot;
Holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed , but I observed all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful mood , and he gave me the impression , from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner , of a man who is <unk> to recall something to his memory .
We were in the middle of our lunch when he suddenly sprang to his feet .
&quot; By Jove , Watson ; I &apos;ve got it ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; Take your hat !
Come with me ! &quot;
He hurried at his top <unk> down Baker Street and along Oxford Street , until we had almost reached <unk> <unk> .
Here on the left hand there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the <unk> and <unk> of the day .
Holmes &apos;s eyes fixed themselves upon one of them , and following his gaze I saw the picture of a <unk> and stately lady in Court dress , with a high <unk> <unk> upon her noble head .
I looked at that <unk> nose , at the marked eyebrows , at the straight mouth , and the strong little chin beneath it .
Then I caught my breath as I read the <unk> title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been .
My eyes met those of Holmes , and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window .
It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , to look in upon us of an evening , and his visits were welcome to Sherlock Holmes , for they <unk> him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police headquarters .
In return for the news which Lestrade would bring , Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the detective was engaged , and was able occasionally , without any active interference , to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own <unk> knowledge and experience .
On this particular evening Lestrade had spoken of the weather and the <unk> .
Then he had fallen silent , puffing thoughtfully at his cigar .
Holmes looked keenly at him .
&quot; Anything remarkable on hand ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; Oh , no , Mr. Holmes , nothing very particular . &quot;
&quot; Then tell me about it . &quot;
Lestrade laughed .
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , there is no use denying that there is something on my mind .
And yet it is such an absurd business that I hesitated to <unk> you about it .
On the other hand , although it is trivial , it is undoubtedly queer , and I know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common .
But in my opinion it comes more in Dr. Watson &apos;s line than ours . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
said I.
&quot; <unk> , anyhow .
And a queer <unk> too !
You wouldn &apos;t think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that he could see . &quot;
Holmes sank back in his chair .
&quot; That &apos;s no business of mine , &quot; said he .
&quot; Exactly .
That &apos;s what I said .
But then , when the man <unk> <unk> in order to break <unk> which are not his own , that <unk> it away from the doctor and on to the policeman . &quot;
Holmes sat up again .
&quot; <unk> !
This is more interesting .
Let me hear the details . &quot;
Lestrade took out his official notebook and <unk> his memory from its pages .
&quot; The first case reported was four days ago , &quot; said he .
&quot; It was at the shop of Morse Hudson , who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the Kennington Road .
The assistant had left the front shop for an instant when he heard a <unk> , and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon , which stood with several other works of art upon the counter , lying <unk> into fragments .
He rushed out into the road , but , although several passersby declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop , he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of <unk> the rascal .
It seemed to be one of those senseless <unk> of <unk> which occur from time to time , and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such .
The plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings , and the whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation .
&quot; The second case , however , was more serious and also more singular .
It occurred only last night .
&quot; In Kennington Road , and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson &apos;s shop , there lives a wellknown medical <unk> , named Dr. Barnicot , who has one of the largest <unk> upon the south side of the Thames .
His residence and principal consultingroom is at Kennington Road , but he has a branch surgery and <unk> at Lower Brixton Road , two miles away .
This Dr. Barnicot is an <unk> admirer of Napoleon , and his house is full of books , pictures , and <unk> of the French Emperor .
Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor , Devine .
One of these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road , and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower Brixton .
Well , when Dr. Barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been <unk> during the night , but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall .
It had been carried out and had been dashed <unk> against the garden wall , under which its splintered fragments were discovered . &quot;
Holmes rubbed his hands .
&quot; This is certainly very <unk> , &quot; said he .
&quot; I thought it would please you .
But I have not got to the end yet .
Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o &apos;clock , and you can imagine his amazement when , on <unk> there , he found that the window had been opened in the night , and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room .
It had been smashed to <unk> where it stood .
In neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief .
Now , Mr. Holmes , you have got the facts . &quot;
&quot; They are singular , not to say grotesque , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot &apos;s rooms were the exact <unk> of the one which was destroyed in Morse Hudson &apos;s shop ? &quot;
&quot; They were taken from the same <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who <unk> them is <unk> by any general hatred of Napoleon .
<unk> how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must <unk> in London , it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous <unk> should chance to begin upon three <unk> of the same bust . &quot;
&quot; Well , I thought as you do , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; On the other hand , this Morse Hudson is the <unk> of busts in that part of London , and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years .
So , although , as you say , there are many hundreds of statues in London , it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district .
Therefore , a local <unk> would begin with them .
What do you think , Dr.
Watson ? &quot;
&quot; There are no <unk> to the possibilities of <unk> , &quot; I answered .
&quot; There is the condition which the modern French <unk> have called the &apos; idée fixe , &apos; which may be trifling in character , and accompanied by complete <unk> in every other way .
A man who had read deeply about Napoleon , or who had possibly received some <unk> family injury through the great war , might conceivably form such an idée fixe and under its influence be capable of any <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; That won &apos;t do , my dear Watson , &quot; said Holmes , shaking his head ; &quot; for no amount of idée fixe would <unk> your interesting <unk> to find out where these busts were situated . &quot;
&quot; Well , how do you explain it ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t attempt to do so .
I would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentleman &apos;s eccentric <unk> .
For example , in Dr. Barnicot &apos;s hall , where a sound might arouse the family , the bust was taken outside before being broken , <unk> in the surgery , where there was less danger of an alarm , it was smashed where it stood .
The affair seems absurdly trifling , and yet I dare call nothing trivial when I <unk> that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising <unk> .
You will remember , Watson , how the dreadful business of the <unk> family was first brought to my notice by the <unk> which the <unk> had sunk into the <unk> upon a hot day .
I can &apos;t afford , therefore , to smile at your three broken busts , Lestrade , and I shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh developments of so singular a chain of events . &quot;
The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined .
I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning when there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered , a telegram in his hand .
He read it aloud : &quot; Come instantly , 131 , Pitt Street , Kensington .
&quot; Lestrade . &quot;
&quot; What is it , then ? &quot;
I asked .
&quot; Don &apos;t <unk> be anything .
But I suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues .
In that case our friend , the <unk> , has begun operations in another quarter of London .
There &apos;s coffee on the table , Watson , and I have a cab at the door . &quot;
In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street , a quiet little <unk> just beside one of the <unk> <unk> of London life .
No .
131 was one of a row , all <unk> , respectable , and most <unk> dwellings .
As we drove up we found the <unk> in front of the house lined by a curious crowd .
Holmes whistled .
&quot; By George !
it &apos;s attempted murder at the least .
Nothing less will hold the London <unk> .
There &apos;s a deed of violence <unk> in that fellow &apos;s round shoulders and outstretched neck .
What &apos;s this , Watson ?
The top steps <unk> down and the other ones dry .
<unk> enough , anyhow !
Well , well , there &apos;s Lestrade at the front window , and we shall soon know all about it . &quot;
The official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a sittingroom , where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man , clad in a flannel dressinggown , was pacing up and down .
He was introduced to us as the owner of the <unk> .
Horace Harker , of the Central Press Syndicate .
&quot; It &apos;s the Napoleon bust business again , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; You seemed interested last night , Mr. Holmes , so I thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn . &quot;
&quot; What has it turned to , then ? &quot;
&quot; To murder .
Mr. Harker , will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred ? &quot;
The man in the dressinggown turned upon us with a most melancholy face .
&quot; It &apos;s an extraordinary thing , &quot; said he , &quot; that all my life I have been <unk> other people &apos;s news , and now that a real piece of news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can &apos;t put two words together .
If I had come in here as a journalist I should have <unk> myself and had two columns in every evening paper .
As it is I am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people , and I can make no use of it myself .
However , I &apos;ve heard your name , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , and if you &apos;ll only explain this queer business I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story . &quot;
Holmes sat down and listened .
&quot; It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for this very room about four months ago .
I picked it up <unk> from Harding Brothers , two doors from the High Street Station .
A great deal of my <unk> work is done at night , and I often write until the early morning .
So it was today .
I was sitting in my den , which is at the back of the top of the house , about three o &apos;clock , when I was convinced that I heard some sounds downstairs .
I listened , but they were not repeated , and I concluded that they came from outside .
Then suddenly , about five minutes later , there came a most horrible <unk> most dreadful sound , Mr. Holmes , that ever I heard .
It will ring in my ears as long as I live .
I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two .
Then I seized the poker and went downstairs .
When I entered this room I found the window wide open , and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece .
Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my <unk> , for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever .
&quot; You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long <unk> .
This was clearly what the burglar had done , so I went round and opened the door .
<unk> out into the dark I nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there .
I ran back for a light , and there was the poor fellow , a great <unk> in his throat and the whole place <unk> in blood .
He lay on his back , his knees drawn up , and his mouth horribly open .
I shall see him in my dreams .
I had just time to blow on my <unk> , and then I must have fainted , for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman standing over me in the hall . &quot;
&quot; Well , who was the murdered man ? &quot;
asked Holmes .
&quot; There &apos;s nothing to show who he was , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; You shall see the body at the <unk> , but we have made nothing of it up to now .
He is a tall man , sunburned , very powerful , not more than thirty .
He is <unk> dressed , and yet does not appear to be a <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him .
Whether it was the weapon which did the deed , or whether it belonged to the dead man , I do not know .
There was no name on his clothing , and nothing in his pockets save an <unk> , some string , a shilling map of London , and a photograph .
Here it is . &quot;
It was evidently taken by a <unk> from a small <unk> .
It represented an alert , <unk> <unk> man with thick eyebrows , and a very peculiar <unk> of the lower part of the face like the muzzle of a <unk> .
&quot; And what became of the bust ? &quot;
asked Holmes , after a careful study of this picture .
&quot; We had news of it just before you came .
It has been found in the front garden of an empty house in <unk> House Road .
It was broken into fragments .
I am going round now to see it .
Will you come ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly .
I must just take one look round . &quot;
He examined the carpet and the window .
&quot; The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man , &quot; said he .
&quot; With an area beneath , it was no mean <unk> to reach that <unk> and open that window .
<unk> back was comparatively simple .
Are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust , Mr.
Harker ? &quot;
The <unk> journalist had seated himself at a writingtable .
&quot; I must try and make something of it , &quot; said he , &quot; though I have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details .
It &apos;s like my luck !
You remember when the stand fell at <unk> ?
Well , I was the only journalist in the stand , and my <unk> the only one that had no account of it , for I was too shaken to write it .
And now I &apos;ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep . &quot;
As we left the room we heard his pen <unk> shrilly over the foolscap .
The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a few hundred yards away .
For the first time our eyes rested upon this <unk> of the great Emperor , which seemed to raise such frantic and <unk> hatred in the mind of the unknown .
It lay scattered in splintered <unk> upon the grass .
Holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully .
I was convinced from his intent face and his <unk> manner that at last he was upon a clue .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
asked Lestrade .
Holmes shrugged his shoulders .
&quot; We have a long way to go yet , &quot; said he .
&quot; And yetand <unk> , we have some suggestive facts to act upon .
The possession of this trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of this strange criminal than a human life .
That is one point .
Then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house , or immediately outside the house , if to break it was his sole object . &quot;
&quot; He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow .
He hardly knew what he was doing . &quot;
&quot; Well , that &apos;s likely enough .
But I wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of which the bust was destroyed . &quot;
Lestrade looked about him .
&quot; It was an empty house , and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden . &quot;
&quot; Yes , but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one .
Why did he not break it there , since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him ? &quot;
&quot; I give it up , &quot; said Lestrade .
Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads .
&quot; He could see what he was doing here and he could not there .
That was his reason . &quot;
&quot; By Jove !
that &apos;s true , &quot; said the detective .
&quot; Now that I come to think of it , Dr. Barnicot &apos;s bust was broken not far from his red lamp .
Well , Mr. Holmes , what are we to do with that fact ? &quot;
&quot; To remember <unk> <unk> it .
We may come on something later which will bear upon it .
What steps do you propose to take now , Lestrade ? &quot;
&quot; The most practical way of getting at it , in my opinion , is to identify the dead man .
There should be no difficulty about that .
When we have found who he is and who his <unk> are , we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night , and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker .
Don &apos;t you think so ? &quot;
&quot; No doubt ; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should approach the case . &quot;
&quot; What would you do , then ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , you must not let me influence you in any way !
I suggest that you go on your line and I on mine .
We can compare notes afterwards , and each will <unk> the other . &quot;
&quot; Very good , &quot; said Lestrade .
&quot; If you are going back to Pitt Street you might see Mr. Horace Harker .
Tell him from me that I have quite made up my mind , and that it is certain that a dangerous <unk> lunatic with Napoleonic <unk> was in his house last night .
It will be useful for his article . &quot;
Lestrade stared .
&quot; You don &apos;t seriously believe that ? &quot;
Holmes smiled .
&quot; Don &apos;t I ?
Well , perhaps I don &apos;t .
But I am sure that it will interest Mr. Horace Harker and the <unk> of the Central Press Syndicate .
Now , Watson , I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day &apos;s work before us .
I should be glad , Lestrade , if you could make it convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o &apos;clock this evening .
Until then I should like to keep this photograph found in the dead man &apos;s pocket .
It is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken tonight , if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct .
Until then , goodbye and good luck ! &quot;
Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street , where he stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers , whence the bust had been purchased .
A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be absent until after <unk> , and that he was himself a newcomer who could give us no information .
Holmes &apos;s face showed his disappointment and annoyance .
&quot; Well , well , we can &apos;t expect to have it all our own way , Watson , &quot; he said , at last .
&quot; We must come back in the afternoon if Mr. Harding will not be here until then .
I am , as you have no doubt <unk> , endeavouring to trace these busts to their source , in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate .
Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson , of the Kennington Road , and see if he can throw any light upon the problem . &quot;
A drive of an hour brought us to the <unk> &apos;s establishment .
He was a small , stout man with a red face and a <unk> manner .
&quot; Yes , sir .
On my very counter , sir , &quot; said he .
&quot; What we pay <unk> and taxes for I don &apos;t know , when any ruffian can come in and break one &apos;s <unk> .
Yes , sir , it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues .
<unk> , sir !
A <unk> plot , that &apos;s what I make it .
No one but an <unk> would go about breaking statues .
Red <unk> , that &apos;s what I call &apos; <unk> .
Who did I get the statues from ?
I don &apos;t see what that has to do with it .
Well , if you really want to know , I got them from Gelder &amp; Co . , in Church Street , Stepney .
They are a wellknown house in the trade , and have been this twenty years .
How many had I ?
<unk> and one are <unk> of Dr. Barnicot &apos;s and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter .
Do I know that photograph ?
No , I don &apos;t .
Yes , I do , though .
Why , it &apos;s Beppo .
He was a kind of Italian <unk> man , who made himself useful in the shop .
He could <unk> a bit and <unk> and frame , and do odd jobs .
The fellow left me last week , and I &apos;ve heard nothing of him since .
No , I don &apos;t know where he came from nor where he went to .
I have nothing against him while he was here .
He was gone two days before the bust was smashed . &quot;
&quot; Well , that &apos;s all we could <unk> expect to get from Morse Hudson , &quot; said Holmes , as we emerged from the shop .
&quot; We have this Beppo as a common factor , both in Kennington and in Kensington , so that is worth a <unk> drive .
Now , Watson , let us make for Gelder &amp; Co . , of Stepney , the source and origin of busts .
I shall be surprised if we don &apos;t get some help down there . &quot;
In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable London , hotel London , <unk> London , literary London , <unk> London , and , finally , <unk> London , <unk> we came to a <unk> city of a hundred thousand <unk> , where the <unk> houses <unk> and reek with the <unk> of Europe .
Here , in a broad thoroughfare , once the <unk> of wealthy City <unk> , we found the <unk> works for which we searched .
Outside was a considerable yard full of <unk> <unk> .
Inside was a large room in which fifty <unk> were <unk> or moulding .
The manager , a big <unk> German , received us <unk> , and gave a clear answer to all Holmes &apos;s questions .
A reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine &apos;s head of Napoleon , but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a <unk> of six , the other three being sent to Harding Brothers , of Kensington .
There was no reason why those six should be different to any of the other casts .
He could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy <unk> fact , he laughed at the idea .
Their wholesale price was six shillings , but the <unk> would get twelve or more .
The cast was taken in two <unk> from each side of the face , and then these two <unk> of plaster of Paris were joined together to make the complete bust .
The work was usually done by Italians in the room we were in .
When finished the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry , and afterwards <unk> .
That was all he could tell us .
But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the manager .
His face flushed with anger , and his brows <unk> over his blue <unk> eyes .
&quot; Ah , the rascal ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; Yes , indeed , I know him very well .
This has always been a respectable establishment , and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow .
It was more than a year ago now .
He <unk> another Italian in the street , and then he came to the works with the police on his heels , and he was taken here .
Beppo was his <unk> second name I never knew .
<unk> me right for <unk> a man with such a face .
But he was a good workman , one of the best . &quot;
&quot; What did he get ? &quot;
&quot; The man lived and he got off with a year .
I have no doubt he is out now ; but he has not dared to show his nose here .
We have a cousin of his here , and I dare say he could tell you where he is . &quot;
&quot; No , no , &quot; cried Holmes , &quot; not a word to the <unk> a word , I beg you .
The matter is very important , and the farther I go with it the more important it seems to grow .
When you referred in your <unk> to the sale of those casts I observed that the date was June <unk> of last year .
Could you give me the date when Beppo was arrested ? &quot;
&quot; I could tell you roughly by the <unk> , &quot; the manager answered .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he continued , after some turning over of pages , &quot; he was paid last on May <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Thank you , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that I need <unk> upon your time and patience any more . &quot;
With a last word of caution that he should say nothing as to our researches we turned our faces <unk> once more .
The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> at a <unk> .
A <unk> at the entrance announced &quot; Kensington <unk> .
Murder by a <unk> , &quot; and the contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his account into print after all .
Two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and <unk> <unk> of the whole incident .
Holmes propped it against the <unk> and read it while he ate .
Once or twice he chuckled .
&quot; This is all right , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; Listen to this : &quot; It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case , since Mr. Lestrade , one of the most experienced members of the official force , and Mr. Sherlock Holmes , the wellknown consulting expert , have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents , which have ended in so tragic a fashion , arise from <unk> rather than from <unk> crime .
No explanation save mental <unk> can cover the facts .
&quot; The Press , Watson , is a most valuable <unk> if you only know how to use it .
And now , if you have quite finished , we will hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding Brothers has to say to the matter . &quot;
The founder of that great <unk> proved to be a <unk> , <unk> little person , very dapper and quick , with a clear head and a ready <unk> .
&quot; Yes , sir , I have already read the account in the evening papers .
Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours .
We supplied him with the bust some months ago .
We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder &amp; Co . , of Stepney .
They are all sold now .
To whom ?
Oh , I dare say by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you .
Yes , we have the <unk> here .
One to Mr. Harker , you see , and one to Mr. Josiah Brown , of Laburnum Lodge , Laburnum <unk> , Chiswick , and one to Mr. Sandeford , of Lower <unk> Road , Reading .
No , I have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph .
You would hardly forget it , would you , sir , for I &apos;ve seldom seen an <unk> .
Have we any Italians on the staff ?
Yes , sir , we have several among our <unk> and <unk> .
I dare say they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to .
There is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book .
Well , well , it &apos;s a very strange business , and I hope that you &apos;ll let me know if anything comes of your inquiries . &quot;
Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding &apos;s evidence , and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were taking .
He made no remark , however , save that , unless we hurried , we should be late for our appointment with Lestrade .
<unk> enough , when we reached Baker Street the detective was already there , and we found him pacing up and down in a fever of impatience .
His look of importance showed that his day &apos;s work had not been in vain .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; What luck , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; We have had a very busy day , and not entirely a wasted one , &quot; my friend explained .
&quot; We have seen both the <unk> and also the wholesale <unk> .
I can trace each of the busts now from the beginning . &quot;
&quot; The busts ! &quot;
cried Lestrade .
&quot; Well , well , you have your own methods , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , and it is not for me to say a word against them , but I think I have done a better day &apos;s work than you .
I have identified the dead man . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t say so ? &quot;
&quot; And found a cause for the crime . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; We have an inspector who makes a <unk> of <unk> Hill and the Italian quarter .
Well , this dead man had some <unk> <unk> round his neck , and that , along with his colour , made me think he was from the South .
Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him .
His name is Pietro Venucci , from <unk> , and he is one of the greatest <unk> in London .
He is connected with the Mafia , which , as you know , is a secret political society , <unk> its <unk> by murder .
Now you see how the affair begins to clear up .
The other fellow is probably an Italian also , and a member of the Mafia .
He has broken the rules in some fashion .
Pietro is set upon his track .
Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself , so that he may not knife the wrong person .
He dogs the fellow , he sees him enter a house , he waits outside for him , and in the scuffle he receives his own <unk> .
How is that , Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? &quot;
Holmes clapped his hands approvingly .
&quot; Excellent , Lestrade , excellent ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; But I didn &apos;t quite follow your explanation of the <unk> of the busts . &quot;
&quot; The busts !
You never can get those busts out of your head .
After all , that is nothing ; petty <unk> , six months at the most .
It is the murder that we are really investigating , and I tell you that I am gathering all the threads into my hands . &quot;
&quot; And the next stage ? &quot;
&quot; Is a very simple one .
I shall go down with Hill to the Italian quarter , find the man whose photograph we have got , and arrest him on the charge of murder .
Will you come with us ? &quot;
&quot; I think not .
I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way .
I can &apos;t say for certain , because it all <unk> , it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control .
But I have great <unk> fact , the betting is exactly two to <unk> if you will come with us tonight I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels . &quot;
&quot; In the Italian quarter ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him .
If you will come with me to Chiswick tonight , Lestrade , I &apos;ll promise to go to the Italian quarter with you tomorrow , and no harm will be done by the delay .
And now I think that a few hours &apos; sleep would do us all good , for I do not propose to leave before eleven o &apos;clock , and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning .
You &apos;ll dine with us , Lestrade , and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start .
In the meantime , Watson , I should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger , for I have a letter to send , and it is important that it should go at once . &quot;
Holmes spent the evening in <unk> among the files of the old daily papers with which one of our <unk> was <unk> .
When at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes , but he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches .
For my own part , I had followed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various <unk> of this complex case , and , though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach , I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts , one of which , I remembered , was at Chiswick .
No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act , and I could not but <unk> the cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper , so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity .
I was not surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me .
He had himself picked up the <unk> huntingcrop which was his favourite weapon .
A fourwheeler was at the door at eleven , and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge .
Here the <unk> was directed to wait .
A short walk brought us to a secluded road <unk> with pleasant houses , each standing in its own grounds .
In the light of a street lamp we read &quot; Laburnum <unk> &quot; upon the <unk> of one of them .
The occupants had evidently retired to rest , for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door , which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path .
The wooden <unk> which separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side , and here it was that we crouched .
&quot; I fear that you &apos;ll have a long wait , &quot; Holmes whispered .
&quot; We may thank our stars that it is not <unk> .
I don &apos;t think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time .
However , it &apos;s a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble . &quot;
It proved , however , that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes had led us to fear , and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion .
In an instant , without the least sound to warn us of his coming , the garden gate swung open , and a lithe , dark figure , as swift and active as an ape , rushed up the garden path .
We saw it <unk> past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house .
There was a long pause , during which we held our breath , and then a very gentle <unk> sound came to our ears .
The window was being opened .
The noise ceased , and again there was a long silence .
The fellow was making his way into the house .
We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room .
What he sought was evidently not there , for again we saw the flash through another blind , and then through another .
&quot; Let us get to the open window .
We will <unk> him as he <unk> out , &quot; Lestrade whispered .
But before we could move the man had emerged again .
As he came out into the <unk> patch of light we saw that he carried something white under his arm .
He looked <unk> all round him .
The silence of the deserted street <unk> him .
Turning his back upon us he laid down his <unk> , and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap , followed by a clatter and rattle .
The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot .
With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back , and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and the handcuffs had been fastened .
As we turned him over I saw a hideous , sallow face , with writhing , furious features , <unk> up at us , and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured .
But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention .
<unk> on the doorstep , he was engaged in most carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house .
It was a bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning , and it had been broken into similar fragments .
<unk> Holmes held each separate <unk> to the light , but in no way did it <unk> from any other shattered piece of plaster .
He had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up , the door opened , and the owner of the house , a jovial , <unk> figure in shirt and trousers , presented himself .
&quot; Mr. Josiah Brown , I suppose ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Yes , sir ; and you , no doubt , are Mr. Sherlock Holmes ?
I had the note which you sent by the express messenger , and I did exactly what you told me .
We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments .
Well , I &apos;m very glad to see that you have got the rascal .
I hope , gentlemen , that you will come in and have some <unk> . &quot;
However , Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters , so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon our way to London .
Not a word would our captive say ; but he glared at us from the shadow of his <unk> hair , and once , when my hand seemed within his reach , he snapped at it like a <unk> <unk> .
We stayed long enough at the policestation to learn that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife , the handle of which bore <unk> traces of recent blood .
&quot; That &apos;s all right , &quot; said Lestrade , as we parted .
&quot; Hill knows all these <unk> , and he will give a name to him .
You &apos;ll find that my theory of the Mafia will work out all right .
But I &apos;m sure I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mr. Holmes , for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him .
I don &apos;t quite understand it all yet . &quot;
&quot; I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Besides , there are one or two details which are not finished off , and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end .
If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o &apos;clock tomorrow I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business , which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime .
If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems , Watson , I foresee that you will <unk> your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts . &quot;
When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner .
His name , it appeared , was Beppo , second name unknown .
He was a wellknown <unk> <unk> among the Italian <unk> .
He had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living , but he had taken to evil <unk> and had twice already been in <unk> for a petty <unk> and once , as we had already heard , for stabbing a <unk> .
He could talk English perfectly well .
His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown , and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject ; but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands , since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder &amp; Co . To all this information , much of which we already knew , Holmes listened with polite attention ; but I , who knew him so well , could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere , and I detected a mixture of <unk> <unk> and expectation beneath that mask which he was <unk> to <unk> .
At last he started in his chair and his eyes <unk> .
There had been a ring at the bell .
A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs , and an elderly , <unk> man with grizzled sidewhiskers was ushered in .
In his right hand he carried an oldfashioned <unk> , which he placed upon the table .
&quot; Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here ? &quot;
My friend bowed and smiled .
&quot; Mr. Sandeford , of Reading , I suppose ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; Yes , sir , I fear that I am a little late ; but the trains were awkward .
You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession . &quot;
&quot; Exactly . &quot;
&quot; I have your letter here .
You said , &apos; I desire to possess a copy of Devine &apos;s Napoleon , and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession . &apos;
Is that right ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly . &quot;
&quot; I was very much surprised at your letter , for I could not imagine how you knew that I <unk> such a thing . &quot;
&quot; Of course you must have been surprised , but the explanation is very simple .
Mr. Harding , of Harding Brothers , said that they had sold you their last copy , and he gave me your address . &quot;
&quot; Oh , that was it , was it ?
Did he tell you what I paid for it ? &quot;
&quot; No , he did not . &quot;
&quot; Well , I am an honest man , though not a very rich one .
I only gave fifteen shillings for the bust , and I think you ought to know that before I take ten pounds from you . &quot;
&quot; I am sure the <unk> does you honour , Mr. Sandeford .
But I have named that price , so I intend to stick to it . &quot;
&quot; Well , it is very handsome of you , Mr. Holmes .
I brought the bust up with me , as you asked me to do .
Here it is ! &quot;
He opened his bag , and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments .
Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a <unk> note upon the table .
&quot; You will kindly sign that paper , Mr. Sandeford , in the presence of these <unk> .
It is simply to say that you <unk> every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me .
I am a methodical man , you see , and you never know what turn events might take afterwards .
Thank you , Mr. Sandeford ; here is your money , and I wish you a very good evening . &quot;
When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes &apos;s movements were such as to <unk> our attention .
He began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table .
Then he placed his <unk> bust in the centre of the cloth .
Finally , he picked up his huntingcrop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head .
The figure broke into fragments , and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains .
Next instant , with a loud shout of triumph , he held up one <unk> , in which a round , dark object was fixed like a <unk> in a <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; he cried , &quot; let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the <unk> . &quot;
Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment , and then , with a spontaneous impulse , we both broke out <unk> as at the <unk> crisis of a play .
A <unk> of colour sprang to Holmes &apos;s pale cheeks , and he bowed to us like the master <unk> who receives the <unk> of his audience .
It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine , and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause .
The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend .
&quot; Yes , gentlemen , &quot; said he , &quot; it is the most famous pearl now <unk> in the world , and it has been my good fortune , by a connected chain of <unk> reasoning , to trace it from the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s bedroom at the <unk> Hotel , where it was lost , to the interior of this , the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were <unk> by Gelder &amp; Co . , of Stepney .
You will remember , Lestrade , the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable <unk> , and the vain efforts of the London police to recover it .
I was myself consulted upon the case ; but I was unable to throw any light upon it .
Suspicion fell upon the maid of the <unk> , who was an Italian , and it was proved that she had a brother in London , but we failed to trace any connection between them .
The maid &apos;s name was <unk> Venucci , and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother .
I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper , and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some crime of violence , an event which took place in the factory of Gelder &amp; Co . , at the very moment when these busts were being made .
Now you clearly see the sequence of events , though you see them , of course , in the <unk> order to the way in which they presented themselves to me .
Beppo had the pearl in his possession .
He may have stolen it from Pietro , he may have been Pietro &apos;s confederate , he may have been the <unk> of Pietro and his sister .
It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution .
&quot; The main fact is that he had the pearl , and at that moment , when it was on his person , he was pursued by the police .
He made for the factory in which he worked , and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize , which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched .
Six plaster casts of Napoleon were <unk> in the passage .
One of them was still soft .
In an instant Beppo , a skilful workman , made a small hole in the wet plaster , dropped in the pearl , and with a few <unk> covered over the <unk> once more .
It was an admirable hidingplace .
No one could possibly find it .
But Beppo was condemned to a year &apos;s imprisonment , and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over London .
He could not tell which contained his treasure .
Only by breaking them could he see .
Even shaking would tell him nothing , for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would <unk> to <unk> , in fact , it has done .
Beppo did not despair , and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance .
Through a cousin who works with Gelder he found out the <unk> <unk> who had bought the busts .
He <unk> to find employment with Morse Hudson , and in that way tracked down three of them .
The pearl was not there .
Then , with the help of some Italian <unk> , he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone .
The first was at Harker &apos;s .
There he was dogged by his confederate , who held Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl , and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed . &quot;
&quot; If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph ? &quot;
I asked .
&quot; As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any third person .
That was the obvious reason .
Well , after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements .
He would fear that the police would read his secret , and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him .
Of course , I could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker &apos;s bust .
I had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl ; but it was evident to me that he was looking for something , since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp <unk> it .
Since Harker &apos;s bust was one in three the <unk> were exactly as I told you , two to one against the pearl being inside it .
There remained two busts , and it was obvious that he would go for the London one first .
I warned the <unk> of the house , so as to avoid a second tragedy , and we went down with the <unk> results .
By that time , of course , I knew for certain that it was the <unk> pearl that we were after .
The name of the murdered man <unk> the one event with the other .
There only remained a single <unk> Reading <unk> the pearl must be there .
I bought it in your presence from the <unk> there it lies . &quot;
We sat in silence for a moment .
&quot; Well , &quot; said Lestrade , &quot; I &apos;ve seen you handle a good many cases , Mr. Holmes , but I don &apos;t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that .
We &apos;re not <unk> of you at Scotland Yard .
No , sir , we are very proud of you , and if you come down tomorrow there &apos;s not a man , from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable , who wouldn &apos;t be glad to shake you by the hand . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; Thank you ! &quot;
and as he turned away it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the <unk> human emotions than I had ever seen him .
A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more .
&quot; Put the pearl in the safe , Watson , &quot; said he , &quot; and get out the papers of the <unk> <unk> case .
Goodbye , Lestrade .
If any little problem comes your way I shall be happy , if I can , to give you a hint or two as to its solution . &quot;
It was in the year &apos; 95 that a combination of events , into which I need not enter , caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great University <unk> , and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to <unk> <unk> us .
It will be obvious that any details which would help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would be <unk> and <unk> .
So painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out .
With due discretion the incident itself may , however , be described , since it <unk> to <unk> some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable .
I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place , or give a clue as to the people concerned .
We were <unk> at the time in furnished lodgings close to a <unk> where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early English <unk> which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives .
Here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance , Mr. Hilton Soames , tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke &apos;s .
Mr. Soames was a tall , spare man , of a nervous and excitable <unk> .
I had always known him to be restless in his manner , but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred .
&quot; I trust , Mr. Holmes , that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time .
We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke &apos;s , and really , but for the happy chance of your being in the town , I should have been at a loss what to do . &quot;
&quot; I am very busy just now , and I desire no <unk> , &quot; my friend answered .
&quot; I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police . &quot;
&quot; No , no , my dear sir ; such a course is utterly impossible .
When once the law is <unk> it cannot be stayed again , and this is just one of those cases where , for the credit of the college , it is most essential to avoid scandal .
Your discretion is as well known as your powers , and you are the one man in the world who can help me .
I beg you , Mr. Holmes , to do what you can . &quot;
My friend &apos;s temper had not <unk> since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street .
Without his scrapbooks , his <unk> , and his <unk> untidiness , he was an <unk> man .
He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence , while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable <unk> poured forth his story .
&quot; I must explain to you , Mr. Holmes , that tomorrow is the first day of the examination for the <unk> <unk> .
I am one of the <unk> .
My subject is Greek , and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of Greek <unk> which the candidate has not seen .
This passage is printed on the examination paper , and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance .
For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper secret .
&quot; Today about three o &apos;clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the <unk> .
The exercise consists of half a <unk> of <unk> .
I had to read it over carefully , as the <unk> must be absolutely correct .
At <unk> my task was not yet completed .
I had , however , promised to take tea in a friend &apos;s rooms , so I left the proof upon my desk .
I was absent rather more than an hour .
&quot; You are aware , Mr. Holmes , that our college doors are <unk> green <unk> one within and a heavy oak one without .
As I approached my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it .
For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there , but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right .
The only duplicate which existed , so far as I knew , was that which belonged to my servant , Bannister , a man who has looked after my room for ten years , and whose <unk> is absolutely above suspicion .
I found that the key was indeed his , that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea , and that he had very <unk> left the key in the door when he came out .
His visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it .
His <unk> about the key would have <unk> little upon any other occasion , but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences .
&quot; The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers .
The proof was in three long slips .
I had left them all together .
Now , I found that one of them was lying on the floor , one was on the side table near the window , and the third was where I had left it . &quot;
Holmes stirred for the first time .
&quot; The first page on the floor , the second in the window , the third where you left it , &quot; said he .
&quot; Exactly , Mr. Holmes .
You <unk> me .
How could you possibly know that ? &quot;
&quot; Pray continue your very interesting statement . &quot;
&quot; For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the <unk> liberty of examining my papers .
He <unk> it , however , with the utmost earnestness , and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth .
The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door , had known that I was out , and had entered to look at the papers .
A large sum of money is at stake , for the scholarship is a very valuable one , and an <unk> man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows .
&quot; Bannister was very much upset by the incident .
He had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with .
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I made a most careful examination of the room .
I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers .
On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been <unk> .
A broken tip of lead was lying there also .
Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry , had broken his pencil , and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it . &quot;
&quot; Excellent ! &quot;
said Holmes , who was recovering his goodhumour as his attention became more <unk> by the case .
&quot; <unk> has been your friend . &quot;
&quot; This was not all .
I have a new writingtable with a fine surface of red leather .
I am prepared to swear , and so is Bannister , that it was smooth and <unk> .
Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches <unk> a mere scratch , but a positive cut .
Not only this , but on the table I found a small <unk> of black <unk> , or clay , with <unk> of something which looks like sawdust in it .
I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers .
There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity .
I was at my wits &apos; ends , when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town , and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands .
Do help me , Mr. Holmes !
You see my dilemma .
Either I must find the man or else the examination must be <unk> until fresh papers are prepared , and since this cannot be done without explanation there will <unk> a hideous scandal , which will throw a cloud not only on the college , but on the University .
Above all things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly . &quot;
&quot; I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I can , &quot; said Holmes , rising and putting on his overcoat .
&quot; The case is not entirely <unk> of interest .
Had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; young Daulat Ras , an Indian student who lives on the same stair , came in to ask me some particulars about the examination . &quot;
&quot; For which he was entered ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; And the papers were on your table ? &quot;
&quot; To the best of my belief they were rolled up . &quot;
&quot; But might be recognised as proofs ? &quot;
&quot; Possibly . &quot;
&quot; No one else in your room ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; Did anyone know that these proofs would be there ? &quot;
&quot; No one save the printer . &quot;
&quot; Did this man Bannister know ? &quot;
&quot; No , certainly not .
No one knew . &quot;
&quot; Where is Bannister now ? &quot;
&quot; He was very ill , poor fellow .
I left him collapsed in the chair .
I was in such a hurry to come to you . &quot;
&quot; You left your door open ? &quot;
&quot; I locked up the papers first . &quot;
&quot; Then it <unk> to this , Mr. Soames , that unless the Indian student recognised the roll as being proofs , the man who tampered with them came upon them <unk> without knowing that they were there . &quot;
&quot; So it seems to me . &quot;
Holmes gave an enigmatic smile .
&quot; Well , &quot; said he , &quot; let us go round .
Not one of your cases , <unk> , not physical .
All right ; come if you want to .
Now , Mr. <unk> your disposal ! &quot;
The sittingroom of our client opened by a long , low , <unk> window on to the ancient <unk> court of the old college .
A <unk> <unk> door led to a worn stone <unk> .
On the ground floor was the tutor &apos;s room .
Above were three students , one on each story .
It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem .
Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window .
Then he approached it , and , standing on tiptoe with his neck <unk> , he looked into the room .
&quot; He must have entered through the door .
There is no opening except the one <unk> , &quot; said our learned guide .
&quot; Dear me ! &quot;
said Holmes , and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion .
&quot; Well , if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside . &quot;
The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room .
We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet .
&quot; I am afraid there are no signs here , &quot; said he .
&quot; One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day .
Your servant seems to have quite recovered .
You left him in a chair , you say ; which chair ? &quot;
&quot; By the window there . &quot;
&quot; I see .
Near this little table .
You can come in now .
I have finished with the carpet .
Let us take the little table first .
Of course , what has happened is very clear .
The man entered and took the papers , sheet by sheet , from the central table .
He carried them over to the window table , because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard , and so could effect an escape . &quot;
&quot; As a matter of fact he could not , &quot; said Soames , &quot; for I entered by the side door . &quot;
&quot; Ah , that &apos;s good !
Well , anyhow , that was in his mind .
Let me see the three <unk> .
No finger <unk> !
Well , he carried over this one first and he copied it .
How long would it take him to do that , using every possible contraction ?
A quarter of an hour , not less .
Then he tossed it down and seized the next .
He was in the <unk> of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried <unk> hurried , since he had not time to <unk> the papers which would tell you that he had been there .
You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door ? &quot;
&quot; No , I can &apos;t say I was . &quot;
&quot; Well , he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil , and had , as you observe , to sharpen it again .
This is of interest , Watson .
The pencil was not an ordinary one .
It was above the usual size , with a soft lead ; the outer colour was dark blue , the maker &apos;s name was printed in silver <unk> , and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long .
Look for such a pencil , Mr. Soames , and you have got your man .
When I add that he possesses a large and very <unk> knife , you have an <unk> aid . &quot;
Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information .
&quot; I can follow the other points , &quot; said he , &quot; but really , in this matter of the length &quot; wood after them .
&quot; You see ? &quot;
&quot; No , I fear that even now &quot; &quot; Watson , I have always done you an injustice .
There are others .
What Johann <unk> is the most common maker &apos;s name .
Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann ? &quot;
He held the small table sideways to the electric light .
&quot; I was <unk> that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface .
No , I see nothing .
I don &apos;t think there is anything more to be learned here .
Now for the central table .
This small pellet is , I presume , the black , doughy mass you spoke of .
<unk> <unk> in shape and <unk> out , I perceive .
As you say , there appear to be <unk> of sawdust in it .
Dear me , this is very interesting .
And the <unk> positive tear , I see .
It began with a thin scratch and ended in a <unk> hole .
I am much indebted to you for <unk> my attention to this case , Mr. Soames .
Where does that door lead to ? &quot;
&quot; To my bedroom . &quot;
&quot; Have you been in it since your adventure ? &quot;
&quot; No ; I came straight away for you . &quot;
&quot; I should like to have a glance round .
What a charming , oldfashioned room !
Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until I have examined the floor .
No , I see nothing .
What about this curtain ?
You hang your clothes behind it .
If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there , since the bed is too low and the <unk> too shallow .
No one there , I suppose ? &quot;
As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware , from some little rigidity and <unk> of his attitude , that he was prepared for an emergency .
As a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of <unk> .
Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor .
&quot; Halloa !
What &apos;s this ? &quot;
said he .
It was a small <unk> of black , <unk> <unk> , exactly like the one upon the table of the study .
Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light .
&quot; Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sittingroom , Mr.
Soames . &quot;
&quot; What could he have wanted there ? &quot;
&quot; I think it is clear enough .
You came back by an unexpected way , and so he had no warning until you were at the very door .
What could he do ?
He caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself . &quot;
&quot; Good gracious , Mr. Holmes , do you mean to tell me that all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it ? &quot;
&quot; So I read it . &quot;
&quot; Surely there is another alternative , Mr. Holmes .
I don &apos;t know whether you observed my bedroom window ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , lead <unk> , three separate windows , one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible .
The man might have effected his entrance there , left traces as he passed through the bedroom , and , finally , finding the door open have escaped that way . &quot;
Holmes shook his head impatiently .
&quot; Let us be practical , &quot; said he .
&quot; I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , there are . &quot;
&quot; And they are all in for this examination ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others ? &quot;
Soames hesitated .
&quot; It is a very delicate question , &quot; said he .
&quot; One hardly <unk> to throw suspicion where there are no proofs . &quot;
&quot; Let us hear the suspicions .
I will look after the proofs . &quot;
&quot; I will tell you , then , in a few words the character of the three men who <unk> these rooms .
The lower of the three is Gilchrist , a fine scholar and athlete ; <unk> in the <unk> team and the <unk> team for the college , and got his <unk> for the <unk> and the long jump .
He is a fine , manly fellow .
His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist , who ruined himself on the turf .
My scholar has been left very poor , but he is hardworking and <unk> .
He will do well .
&quot; The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras , the Indian .
He is a quiet , inscrutable fellow , as most of those <unk> are .
He is well up in his work , though his Greek is his weak subject .
He is steady and methodical .
&quot; The top floor belongs to Miles <unk> .
He is a brilliant fellow when he <unk> to <unk> of the brightest <unk> of the University , but he is <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
He was nearly <unk> over a card scandal in his first year .
He has been <unk> all this term , and he must look forward with dread to the examination . &quot;
&quot; Then it is he whom you suspect ? &quot;
&quot; I dare not go so far as that .
But of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
Now , Mr. Soames , let us have a look at your servant , Bannister . &quot;
He was a little , <unk> , cleanshaven , <unk> fellow of fifty .
He was still <unk> from this sudden <unk> of the quiet routine of his life .
His plump face was twitching with his <unk> , and his fingers could not keep still .
&quot; We are investigating this unhappy business , Bannister , &quot; said his master .
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; I understand , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; that you left your key in the door ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside ? &quot;
&quot; It was most unfortunate , sir .
But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times . &quot;
&quot; When did you enter the room ? &quot;
&quot; It was about halfpast four .
That is Mr. Soames &apos;s tea time . &quot;
&quot; How long did you stay ? &quot;
&quot; When I saw that he was absent I withdrew at once . &quot;
&quot; Did you look at these papers on the table ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; certainly not . &quot;
&quot; How came you to leave the key in the door ? &quot;
&quot; I had the <unk> in my hand .
I thought I would come back for the key .
Then I forgot . &quot;
&quot; Has the outer door a spring lock ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; Then it was open all the time ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; Anyone in the room could get out ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; When Mr. Soames returned and called for you , you were very much disturbed ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I have been here .
I nearly fainted , sir . &quot;
&quot; So I understand .
Where were you when you began to feel bad ? &quot;
&quot; Where was I , sir ?
Why , here , near the door . &quot;
&quot; That is singular , because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner .
Why did you pass these other chairs ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , sir .
It didn &apos;t matter to me where I sat . &quot;
&quot; I really don &apos;t think he knew much about it , Mr. Holmes .
He was looking very <unk> ghastly . &quot;
&quot; You stayed here when your master left ? &quot;
&quot; Only for a minute or so .
Then I locked the door and went to my room . &quot;
&quot; Whom do you suspect ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , I would not venture to say , sir .
I don &apos;t believe there is any gentleman in this University who is capable of <unk> by such an action .
No , sir , I &apos;ll not believe it . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ; that will do , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Oh , one more word .
You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you <unk> that anything is amiss ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; not a word . &quot;
&quot; You haven &apos;t seen any of them ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; Very good .
Now , Mr. Soames , we will take a walk in the quadrangle , if you please . &quot;
Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom .
&quot; Your three birds are all in their <unk> , &quot; said Holmes , looking up .
&quot; Halloa !
What &apos;s that ?
One of them seems restless enough . &quot;
It was the Indian , whose dark <unk> appeared suddenly upon his blind .
He was pacing swiftly up and down his room .
&quot; I should like to have a peep at each of them , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Is it possible ? &quot;
&quot; No difficulty in the world , &quot; Soames answered .
&quot; This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college , and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them .
Come along , and I will personally conduct you . &quot;
&quot; No names , please ! &quot;
said Holmes , as we knocked at Gilchrist &apos;s door .
A tall , flaxenhaired , slim young fellow opened it , and made us welcome when he understood our errand .
There were some really curious pieces of <unk> domestic <unk> within .
Holmes was so <unk> with one of them that he <unk> on drawing it on his notebook , broke his pencil , had to <unk> one from our host , and finally <unk> a knife to sharpen his own .
The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the <unk> silent , little , <unk> fellow , who <unk> us <unk> and was obviously glad when Holmes &apos;s <unk> <unk> had come to an end .
I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching .
Only at the third did our visit prove <unk> .
The outer door would not open to our knock , and nothing more substantial than a <unk> of bad language came from behind it .
&quot; I don &apos;t care who you are .
You can go to <unk> ! &quot;
roared the angry voice .
&quot; Tomorrow &apos;s the <unk> , and I won &apos;t be drawn by anyone . &quot;
&quot; A rude fellow , &quot; said our guide , <unk> with anger as we withdrew down the stair .
&quot; Of course , he did not realize that it was I who was knocking , but none the less his conduct was very <unk> , and , indeed , under the circumstances rather suspicious . &quot;
Holmes &apos;s response was a curious one .
&quot; Can you tell me his exact height ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; <unk> , Mr. Holmes , I cannot undertake to say .
He is <unk> than the Indian , not so tall as Gilchrist .
I suppose five foot six would be about it . &quot;
&quot; That is very important , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; And now , Mr. Soames , I wish you goodnight . &quot;
Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay .
&quot; Good gracious , Mr. Holmes , you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion !
You don &apos;t seem to realize the position .
Tomorrow is the examination .
I must take some definite action tonight .
I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with .
The situation must be faced . &quot;
&quot; You must leave it as it is .
I shall drop round early tomorrow morning and <unk> the matter over .
It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action .
Meanwhile you change <unk> at all . &quot;
&quot; Very good , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; You can be perfectly easy in your mind .
We shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties .
I will take the black clay with me , also the pencil <unk> .
Goodbye . &quot;
When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows .
The Indian still paced his room .
The others were invisible .
&quot; Well , Watson , what do you think of it ? &quot;
Holmes asked , as we came out into the main street .
&quot; Quite a little parlour <unk> of <unk> trick , is it not ?
There are your three men .
It must be one of them .
You take your choice .
Which is yours ? &quot;
&quot; The foulmouthed fellow at the top .
He is the one with the worst record .
And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also .
Why should he be pacing his room all the time ? &quot;
&quot; There is nothing in that .
Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart . &quot;
&quot; He looked at us in a queer way . &quot;
&quot; So would you if a <unk> of strangers came in on you when you were <unk> for an examination next day , and every moment was of value .
No , I see nothing in that .
<unk> , too , and <unk> was satisfactory .
But that fellow does puzzle me . &quot;
&quot; Who ? &quot;
&quot; Why , Bannister , the servant .
What &apos;s his game in the matter ? &quot;
&quot; He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man . &quot;
&quot; So he did me .
That &apos;s the <unk> part .
Why should a perfectly honest <unk> , well , here &apos;s a large <unk> &apos;s .
We shall begin our researches here . &quot;
There were only four <unk> of any consequence in the town , and at each Holmes produced his pencil <unk> and <unk> high for a duplicate .
All were agreed that one could be ordered , but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock .
My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure , but shrugged his shoulders in <unk> <unk> .
&quot; No good , my dear Watson .
This , the best and only final clue , has run to nothing .
But , indeed , I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it .
By Jove !
my dear fellow , it is nearly nine , and the landlady <unk> of green <unk> at seventhirty .
What with your eternal tobacco , Watson , and your <unk> at meals , I expect that you will get notice to <unk> and that I shall share your <unk> , however , before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor , the <unk> servant , and the three <unk> students . &quot;
Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day , though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner .
At eight in the morning he came into my room just as I finished my <unk> .
&quot; Well , Watson , &quot; said he , &quot; it is time we went down to St. Luke &apos;s .
Can you do without breakfast ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly . &quot;
&quot; Soames will be in a dreadful <unk> until we are able to tell him something positive . &quot;
&quot; Have you anything positive to tell him ? &quot;
&quot; I think so . &quot;
&quot; You have formed a conclusion ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , my dear Watson ; I have solved the mystery . &quot;
&quot; But what fresh evidence could you have got ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> !
It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the <unk> hour of six .
I have put in two hours &apos; hard work and covered at least five miles , with something to show for it .
Look at that ! &quot;
He held out his hand .
On the palm were three little <unk> of black , doughy clay .
&quot; Why , Holmes , you had only two yesterday ! &quot;
&quot; And one more this morning .
It is a fair argument that wherever No .
3 came from is also the source of <unk>
1 and 2 .
<unk> , Watson ?
Well , come along and put friend Soames out of his pain . &quot;
The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers .
In a few hours the examination would <unk> , and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and <unk> the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship .
He could hardly stand still , so great was his mental agitation , and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched .
&quot; Thank Heaven that you have come !
I feared that you had given it up in despair .
What am I to do ?
Shall the examination proceed ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; let it proceed by all means . &quot;
&quot; But this rascal ? &quot;
&quot; He shall not compete . &quot;
&quot; You know him ? &quot;
&quot; I think so .
If this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers , and <unk> ourselves into a small private <unk> .
You there , if you please , Soames !
Watson , you here !
I &apos;ll take the armchair in the middle .
I think that we are now sufficiently <unk> to strike terror into a guilty breast .
Kindly ring the bell ! &quot;
Bannister entered , and <unk> back in evident surprise and fear at our <unk> appearance .
&quot; You will kindly close the door , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Now , Bannister , will you please tell us the truth about yesterday &apos;s incident ? &quot;
The man turned white to the <unk> of his hair .
&quot; I have told you everything , sir . &quot;
&quot; Nothing to add ? &quot;
&quot; Nothing at all , sir . &quot;
&quot; Well , then , I must make some suggestions to you .
When you sat down on that chair yesterday , did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room ? &quot;
Bannister &apos;s face was ghastly .
&quot; No , sir ; certainly not . &quot;
&quot; It is only a suggestion , &quot; said Holmes , <unk> .
&quot; I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it .
But it seems probable enough , since the moment that Mr. Soames &apos;s back was turned you <unk> the man who was hiding in that bedroom . &quot;
Bannister <unk> his dry lips .
&quot; There was no man , sir . &quot;
&quot; Ah , that &apos;s a pity , Bannister .
Up to now you may have spoken the truth , but now I know that you have lied . &quot;
The man &apos;s face set in sullen defiance .
&quot; There was no man , sir . &quot;
&quot; Come , come , Bannister ! &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; there was no one . &quot;
&quot; In that case you can give us no further information .
Would you please remain in the room ?
Stand over there near the bedroom door .
Now , Soames , I am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist , and to ask him to step down into yours . &quot;
An instant later the tutor returned , bringing with him the student .
He was a fine figure of a man , tall , lithe , and <unk> , with a springy step and a pleasant , open face .
His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us , and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner .
&quot; Just close the door , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Now , Mr. Gilchrist , we are all quite alone here , and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us .
We can be perfectly frank with each other .
We want to know , Mr. Gilchrist , how you , an honourable man , ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday ? &quot;
The unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of horror and <unk> at Bannister .
&quot; No , no , Mr. Gilchrist , sir ; I never said a <unk> one word ! &quot;
cried the servant .
&quot; No , but you have now , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Now , sir , you must see that after Bannister &apos;s words your position is hopeless , and that your only chance lies in a frank confession . &quot;
For a moment Gilchrist , with upraised hand , tried to control his writhing features .
The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table and , <unk> his face in his hands , he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing .
&quot; Come , come , &quot; said Holmes , kindly ; &quot; it is human to <unk> , and at least no one can accuse you of being a <unk> criminal .
Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames what occurred , and you can check me where I am wrong .
Shall I do so ?
Well , well , don &apos;t trouble to answer .
Listen , and see that I do you no injustice .
&quot; From the moment , Mr. Soames , that you said to me that no one , not even Bannister , could have told that the papers were in your room , the case began to take a definite shape in my mind .
The printer one could , of course , dismiss .
He could examine the papers in his own office .
The Indian I also thought nothing of .
If the proofs were in a roll he could not possibly know what they were .
On the other hand , it seemed an <unk> coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room , and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table .
I dismissed that .
The man who entered knew that the papers were there .
How did he know ?
&quot; When I approached your room I examined the window .
You amused me by supposing that I was <unk> the possibility of someone having in broad daylight , under the eyes of all these opposite rooms , forced himself through it .
Such an idea was absurd .
I was <unk> how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table .
I am six feet high , and I could do it with an effort .
No one less than that would have a chance .
Already you see I had reason to think that if one of your three students was a man of unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three .
&quot; I entered and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table .
Of the centre table I could make nothing , until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a <unk> <unk> .
Then the whole thing came to me in an instant , and I only needed certain <unk> proofs , which I <unk> obtained .
&quot; What happened was this .
This young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds , where he had been <unk> the jump .
He returned carrying his <unk> shoes , which are provided , as you are aware , with several sharp <unk> .
As he passed your window he saw , by means of his great height , these proofs upon your table , and conjectured what they were .
No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the <unk> of your servant .
A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs .
It was not a dangerous exploit , for he could always <unk> that he had simply looked in to ask a question .
&quot; Well , when he saw that they were indeed the proofs , it was then that he yielded to <unk> .
He put his shoes on the table .
What was it you put on that chair near the window ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; said the young man .
Holmes looked <unk> at Bannister .
&quot; He put his gloves on the chair , and he took the proofs , sheet by sheet , to copy them .
He thought the tutor must return by the main gate , and that he would see him .
As we know , he came back by the side gate .
Suddenly he heard him at the very door .
There was no possible escape .
He forgot his gloves , but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom .
You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side , but <unk> in the direction of the bedroom door .
That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the culprit had taken <unk> there .
The earth round the <unk> had been left on the table , and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom .
I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this morning , saw that <unk> black clay is used in the <unk> , and carried away a specimen of it , together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from <unk> .
Have I told the truth , Mr.
Gilchrist ? &quot;
The student had drawn himself erect .
&quot; Yes , sir , it is true , &quot; said he .
&quot; Good heavens , have you nothing to add ? &quot;
cried Soames .
&quot; Yes , sir , I have , but the shock of this <unk> exposure has <unk> me .
I have a letter here , Mr. Soames , which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night .
It was before I knew that my <unk> had found me out .
Here it is , sir .
You will see that I have said , &apos; I have determined not to go in for the examination .
I have been offered a <unk> in the <unk> Police , and I am going out to South Africa at once . &apos; &quot;
&quot; I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage , &quot; said Soames .
&quot; But why did you change your purpose ? &quot;
Gilchrist pointed to Bannister .
&quot; There is the man who set me in the right path , &quot; said he .
&quot; Come now , Bannister , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; It will be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out , since you were left in the room , and must have locked the door when you went out .
As to his <unk> by that window , it was incredible .
Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery , and tell us the reasons for your action ? &quot;
&quot; It was simple enough , sir , if you only had known ; but with all your <unk> it was impossible that you could know .
<unk> was , sir , when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist , this young gentleman &apos;s father .
When he was ruined I came to the college as servant , but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world .
I watched his son all I could for the sake of the old days .
Well , sir , when I came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given , the very first thing I saw was Mr. Gilchrist &apos;s tan gloves <unk> in that chair .
I knew those gloves well , and I understood their message .
If Mr. Soames saw them the game was up .
I <unk> down into that chair , and nothing would <unk> me until Mr. Soames he went for you .
Then out came my poor young master , whom I had <unk> on my knee , and confessed it all to me .
<unk> &apos;t it natural , sir , that I should save him , and wasn &apos;t it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done , and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed ?
Could you blame me , sir ? &quot;
&quot; No , indeed , &quot; said Holmes , heartily , springing to his feet .
&quot; Well , Soames , I think we have cleared your little problem up , and our breakfast awaits us at home .
Come , Watson !
As to you , sir , I trust that a bright future awaits you in <unk> .
For once you have fallen low .
Let us see in the future how high you can rise . &quot;
When I look at the three massive <unk> volumes which contain our work for the year 1894 I confess that it is very difficult for me , out of such a wealth of material , to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves and at the same time most <unk> to a <unk> of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous .
As I turn over the pages I see my notes upon the <unk> story of the red <unk> and the terrible death of <unk> the banker .
Here also I find an account of the <unk> tragedy and the singular contents of the ancient British <unk> .
The famous <unk> succession case comes also within this period , and so does the <unk> and arrest of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> exploit which won for Holmes an <unk> letter of thanks from the French <unk> and the Order of the <unk> of <unk> .
Each of these would <unk> a narrative , but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them <unk> so many singular points of interest as the <unk> of Yoxley Old Place , which includes not only the <unk> death of young Willoughby Smith , but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the <unk> of the crime .
It was a wild , tempestuous night towards the close of <unk> .
Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening , he engaged with a powerful lens <unk> the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest , I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery .
Outside the wind howled down Baker Street , while the rain beat fiercely against the windows .
It was strange there in the very depths of the town , with ten miles of man &apos;s handiwork on every side of us , to feel the iron grip of Nature , and to be conscious that to the huge <unk> forces all London was no more than the <unk> that dot the fields .
I walked to the window and looked out on the deserted street .
The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement .
A single cab was splashing its way from the Oxford Street end .
&quot; Well , Watson , it &apos;s as well we have not to turn out tonight , &quot; said Holmes , laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest .
&quot; I &apos;ve done enough for one sitting .
It is trying work for the eyes .
So far as I can make out it is nothing more <unk> than an Abbey &apos;s accounts <unk> from the second half of the fifteenth century .
Halloa !
halloa !
halloa !
What &apos;s this ? &quot;
Amid the droning of the wind there had come the <unk> of a horse &apos;s hoofs and the long <unk> of a wheel as it <unk> against the <unk> .
The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door .
&quot; What can he want ? &quot;
I <unk> , as a man stepped out of it .
&quot; <unk> !
He <unk> us .
And we , my poor Watson , want <unk> and cravats and <unk> , and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather .
Wait a bit , though !
There &apos;s the cab off again !
There &apos;s hope yet .
He &apos;d have kept it if he had wanted us to come .
<unk> down , my dear fellow , and open the door , for all <unk> folk have been long in bed . &quot;
When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor I had no difficulty in <unk> him .
It was young Stanley Hopkins , a promising detective , in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very practical interest .
&quot; Is he in ? &quot;
he asked , eagerly .
&quot; Come up , my dear sir , &quot; said Holmes &apos;s voice from above .
&quot; I hope you have no <unk> upon us on such a night as this . &quot;
The detective mounted the stairs , and our lamp gleamed upon his shining <unk> .
I helped him out of it while Holmes knocked a blaze out of the <unk> in the grate .
&quot; Now , my dear Hopkins , draw up and warm your toes , &quot; said he .
&quot; Here &apos;s a cigar , and the doctor has a <unk> containing hot water and a <unk> which is good <unk> on a night like this .
It must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale . &quot;
&quot; It is indeed , Mr. Holmes .
I &apos;ve had a <unk> afternoon , I promise you .
Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century today . &quot;
&quot; Well , it was only a paragraph , and all wrong at that , so you have not missed anything .
I haven &apos;t let the grass grow under my feet .
It &apos;s down in Kent , seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line .
I was wired for at <unk> , reached Yoxley Old Place at five , conducted my investigation , was back at Charing Cross by the last train , and straight to you by cab . &quot;
&quot; Which means , I suppose , that you are not quite clear about your case ? &quot;
&quot; It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it .
So far as I can see it is just as <unk> a business as ever I handled , and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn &apos;t go wrong .
There &apos;s no motive , Mr. Holmes .
That &apos;s what <unk> <unk> can &apos;t put my hand on a motive .
Here &apos;s a man <unk> &apos;s no denying <unk> , so far as I can see , no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm . &quot;
Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair .
&quot; Let us hear about it , &quot; said he .
&quot; I &apos;ve got my facts pretty clear , &quot; said Stanley Hopkins .
&quot; All I want now is to know what they all mean .
The story , so far as I can make it out , is like this .
Some years ago this country house , Yoxley Old Place , was taken by an elderly man , who gave the name of Professor Coram .
He was an invalid , keeping his bed half the time , and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bathchair .
He was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him , and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man .
His household used to <unk> of an elderly housekeeper , Mrs. Marker , and of a maid , Susan Tarlton .
These have both been with him since his arrival , and they seem to be women of excellent character .
The Professor is writing a learned book , and he found it necessary about a year ago to engage a secretary .
The first two that he tried were not successes ; but the third , Mr. Willoughby Smith , a very young man straight from the University , seems to have been just what his employer wanted .
His work consisted in writing all the morning to the Professor &apos;s <unk> , and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day &apos;s work .
This Willoughby Smith has nothing against him either as a boy at <unk> or as a young man at Cambridge .
I have seen his <unk> , and from the first he was a decent , quiet , hardworking fellow , with no weak spot in him at all .
And yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the Professor &apos;s study under circumstances which can point only to murder . &quot;
The wind howled and screamed at the windows .
Holmes and I drew closer to the fire while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative .
&quot; If you were to search all England , &quot; said he , &quot; I don &apos;t suppose you could find a household more selfcontained or free from outside <unk> .
<unk> weeks would pass and not one of them go past the garden gate .
The Professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else .
Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood , and lived very much as his employer did .
The two women had nothing to take them from the house .
Mortimer the gardener , who wheels the bathchair , is an Army <unk> old <unk> man of excellent character .
He does not live in the house , but in a <unk> cottage at the other end of the garden .
Those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place .
At the same time , the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main London to Chatham road .
It opens with a <unk> , and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in .
&quot; Now I will give you the evidence of Susan Tarlton , who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter .
It was in the forenoon , between eleven and twelve .
She was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom .
Professor Coram was still in bed , for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday .
The housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house .
Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom , which he <unk> as a sittingroom ; but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her .
She did not see him , but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick , firm <unk> .
She did not hear the study door close , but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below .
It was a wild , hoarse scream , so strange and <unk> that it might have come either from a man or a woman .
At the same instant there was a heavy thud , which shook the old house , and then all was silence .
The maid stood <unk> for a moment , and then , recovering her courage , she ran downstairs .
The study door was shut , and she opened it .
Inside young Mr. Willoughby Smith was stretched upon the floor .
At first she could see no injury , but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of his neck .
It was <unk> by a very small but very deep wound , which had <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him .
It was one of those small <unk> knives to be found on oldfashioned <unk> , with an ivory handle and a stiff blade .
It was part of the <unk> of the Professor &apos;s own desk .
&quot; At first the maid thought that young Smith was already dead , but on pouring some water from the <unk> over his forehead he opened his eyes for an instant .
<unk> Professor , &apos; he murmured <unk> was she . &apos;
The maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words .
He tried desperately to say something else , and he held his right hand up in the air .
Then he fell back dead .
&quot; In the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene , but she was just too late to catch the young man &apos;s dying words .
<unk> Susan with the body , she hurried to the Professor &apos;s room .
He was sitting up in bed horribly agitated , for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred .
Mrs. Marker is prepared to swear that the Professor was still in his <unk> , and , indeed , it was impossible for him to dress without the help of Mortimer , whose orders were to come at twelve o &apos;clock .
The Professor declares that he heard the distant cry , but that he knows nothing more .
He can give no explanation of the young man &apos;s last words , &apos; The Professorit was she , &apos; but imagines that they were the outcome of <unk> .
He <unk> that Willoughby Smith had not an enemy in the world , and can give no reason for the crime .
His first action was to send Mortimer the gardener for the local police .
A little later the chief constable sent for me .
Nothing was moved before I got there , and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house .
It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice , Mr. Sherlock Holmes .
There was really nothing <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes , &quot; said my companion , with a somewhat bitter smile .
&quot; Well , let us hear about it .
What sort of job did you make of it ? &quot;
&quot; I must ask you first , Mr. Holmes , to glance at this rough plan , which will give you a general idea of the position of the Professor &apos;s study and the various points of the case .
It will help you in following my investigation . &quot;
He unfolded the rough chart , which I here <unk> , and he laid it across Holmes &apos;s knee .
I rose , and , standing behind Holmes , I <unk> it over his shoulder .
Picture : <unk> of the building &apos;s room and corridors &quot; It is very rough , of course , and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential .
All the rest you will see later for yourself .
Now , first of all , <unk> that the assassin entered the house , how did he or she come in ?
Undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door , from which there is direct <unk> to the study .
Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated .
The escape must have also been made along that line , for of the two other exits from the room one was <unk> by Susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the Professor &apos;s bedroom .
I therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path , which was <unk> with recent rain and would certainly show any footmarks .
&quot; My examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal .
No footmarks were to be found on the path .
There could be no question , however , that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path , and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track .
I could not find anything in the nature of a <unk> impression , but the grass was trodden down and someone had undoubtedly passed .
It could only have been the murderer , since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning and the rain had only begun during the night . &quot;
&quot; One moment , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Where does this path lead to ? &quot;
&quot; To the road . &quot;
&quot; How long is it ? &quot;
&quot; A hundred yards or so . &quot;
&quot; At the point where the path passes through the gate you could surely pick up the tracks ? &quot;
&quot; Unfortunately , the path was tiled at that point . &quot;
&quot; Well , on the road itself ? &quot;
&quot; No ; it was all trodden into <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> !
Well , then , these tracks upon the grass , were they coming or going ? &quot;
&quot; It was impossible to say .
There was never any outline . &quot;
&quot; A large foot or a small ? &quot;
&quot; You could not <unk> . &quot;
Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience .
&quot; It has been pouring rain and blowing a <unk> ever since , &quot; said he .
&quot; It will be <unk> to read now than that palimpsest .
Well , well , it can &apos;t be helped .
What did you do , Hopkins , after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing ? &quot;
&quot; I think I made certain of a good deal , Mr. Holmes .
I knew that someone had entered the house <unk> from without .
I next examined the corridor .
It is lined with cocoanut matting and had taken no impression of any kind .
This brought me into the study itself .
It is a <unk> room .
The main article is a large writingtable with a fixed bureau .
This bureau consists of a double <unk> of drawers with a central small cupboard between them .
The drawers were open , the cupboard locked .
The drawers , it seems , were always open , and nothing of value was kept in them .
There were some papers of importance in the cupboard , but there were no signs that this had been tampered with , and the Professor <unk> me that nothing was missing .
It is certain that no robbery has been committed .
&quot; I come now to the body of the young man .
It was found near the bureau , and just to the left of it , as marked upon that chart .
The stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forwards , so that it is almost impossible that it could have been <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Unless he fell upon the knife , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Exactly .
The idea crossed my mind .
But we found the knife some feet away from the body , so that seems impossible .
Then , of course , there are the man &apos;s own dying words .
And , finally , there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man &apos;s right hand . &quot;
From his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small paper packet .
He unfolded it and disclosed a golden pincenez , with two broken ends of black silk cord <unk> from the end of it .
&quot; Willoughby Smith had excellent sight , &quot; he added .
&quot; There can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand and examined them with the utmost attention and interest .
He held them on his nose , endeavoured to read through them , went to the window and stared up the street with them , looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp , and finally , with a chuckle , seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper , which he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins .
&quot; That &apos;s the best I can do for you , &quot; said he .
&quot; It may prove to be of some use . &quot;
The astonished detective read the note aloud .
It ran as follows : &quot; <unk> , a woman of good address , <unk> like a lady .
She has a remarkably thick nose , with eyes which are set close upon either side of it .
She has a puckered forehead , a peering expression , and probably rounded shoulders .
There are indications that she has had <unk> to an optician at least twice during the last few months .
As her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very numerous , there should be no difficulty in tracing her . &quot;
Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins , which must have been <unk> upon my features .
&quot; Surely my deductions are <unk> itself , &quot; said he .
&quot; It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a <unk> field for <unk> than a pair of glasses , especially so remarkable a pair as these .
That they <unk> to a woman I infer from their delicacy , and also , of course , from the last words of the dying man .
As to her being a person of <unk> and well dressed , they are , as you perceive , <unk> mounted in solid gold , and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be <unk> in other respects .
You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose , showing that the lady &apos;s nose was very broad at the base .
This sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one , but there are a sufficient number of <unk> to prevent me from being <unk> or from <unk> upon this point in my description .
My own face is a narrow one , and yet I find that I cannot get my eyes into the centre , or near the centre , of these glasses .
Therefore the lady &apos;s eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose .
You will perceive , Watson , that the glasses are <unk> and of unusual strength .
A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision , which are seen in the forehead , the eyelids , and the shoulders . &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; I said , &quot; I can follow each of your <unk> .
I confess , however , that I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician . &quot;
Holmes took the glasses in his hand .
&quot; You will perceive , &quot; he said , &quot; that the clips are lined with tiny <unk> of cork to <unk> the pressure upon the nose .
One of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent , but the other is new .
Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced .
I should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months .
They exactly correspond , so I gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second . &quot;
&quot; By George , it &apos;s marvellous ! &quot;
cried Hopkins , in an ecstasy of admiration .
&quot; To think that I had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it !
I had intended , however , to go the round of the London opticians . &quot;
&quot; Of course you would .
Meanwhile , have you anything more to tell us about the case ? &quot;
&quot; Nothing , Mr. Holmes .
I think that you know as much as I do <unk> more .
We have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station .
We have heard of none .
What beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime .
Not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
there I am not in a position to help you .
But I suppose you want us to come out tomorrow ? &quot;
&quot; If it is not asking too much , Mr. Holmes .
There &apos;s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at six in the morning , and we should be at Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine . &quot;
&quot; Then we shall take it .
Your case has certainly some features of great interest , and I shall be delighted to look into it .
Well , it &apos;s nearly one , and we had best get a few hours &apos; sleep .
I dare say you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire .
I &apos;ll light my <unk> and give you a <unk> of coffee before we start . &quot;
The gale had blown itself out next day , but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey .
We saw the cold winter sun rise over the <unk> <unk> of the Thames and the long , sullen <unk> of the river , which I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the <unk> <unk> in the earlier days of our career .
After a long and weary journey we alighted at a small station some miles from Chatham .
While a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn we snatched a hurried breakfast , and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place .
A constable met us at the garden gate .
&quot; Well , Wilson , any news ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , nothing . &quot;
&quot; No reports of any stranger seen ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir .
<unk> at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday . &quot;
&quot; Have you had inquiries made at <unk> and lodgings ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; there is no one that we cannot account for . &quot;
&quot; Well , it &apos;s only a reasonable walk to Chatham .
Anyone might stay there , or take a train without being observed .
This is the garden path of which I spoke , Mr. Holmes .
I &apos;ll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday . &quot;
&quot; On which side were the marks on the grass ? &quot;
&quot; This side , sir .
This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flowerbed .
I can &apos;t see the traces now , but they were clear to me then . &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes ; someone has passed along , &quot; said Holmes , stooping over the grass border .
&quot; Our lady must have picked her steps carefully , must she not , since on the one side she would leave a track on the path , and on the other an even <unk> one on the soft bed ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , she must have been a cool hand . &quot;
I saw an intent look pass over Holmes &apos;s face .
&quot; You say that she must have come back this way ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; there is no other . &quot;
&quot; On this strip of grass ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Hum !
It was a very remarkable <unk> remarkable .
Well , I think we have exhausted the path .
Let us go farther .
This garden door is usually kept open , I suppose ?
Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in .
The idea of murder was not in her mind , or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon , instead of having to pick this knife off the writingtable .
She advanced along this corridor , leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting .
Then she found herself in this study .
How long was she there ?
We have no means of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Not more than a few minutes , sir .
I forgot to tell you that Mrs. Marker , the housekeeper , had been in there <unk> not very long <unk> a quarter of an hour , she says . &quot;
&quot; Well , that gives us a limit .
Our lady enters this room and what does she do ?
She goes over to the writingtable .
What for ?
Not for anything in the drawers .
If there had been anything worth her taking it would surely have been locked up .
No ; it was for something in that wooden bureau .
Halloa !
what is that scratch upon the face of it ?
Just hold a match , Watson .
Why did you not tell me of this , Hopkins ? &quot;
The mark which he was examining began upon the brass work on the righthand side of the keyhole , and extended for about four inches , where it had scratched the varnish from the surface .
&quot; I noticed it , Mr. Holmes .
But you &apos;ll always find scratches round a keyhole . &quot;
&quot; This is recent , quite recent .
See how the brass <unk> where it is cut .
An old scratch would be the same colour as the surface .
Look at it through my lens .
There &apos;s the varnish , too , like earth on each side of a furrow .
Is Mrs. Marker there ? &quot;
A <unk> , elderly woman came into the room .
&quot; Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; Did you notice this scratch ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , I did not . &quot;
&quot; I am sure you did not , for a <unk> would have swept away these shreds of varnish .
Who has the key of this bureau ? &quot;
&quot; The Professor keeps it on his watchchain . &quot;
&quot; Is it a simple key ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; it is a <unk> &apos;s key . &quot;
&quot; Very good .
Mrs. Marker , you can go .
Now we are making a little progress .
Our lady enters the room , <unk> to the bureau , and either opens it or tries to do so .
While she is thus engaged young Willoughby Smith enters the room .
In her hurry to <unk> the key she makes this scratch upon the door .
He seizes her , and she , <unk> up the nearest object , which happens to be this knife , strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold .
The blow is a fatal one .
He <unk> and she <unk> , either with or without the object for which she has come .
Is Susan the maid there ?
Could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry , Susan ? &quot;
&quot; No sir ; it is impossible .
Before I got down the stair I &apos;d have seen anyone in the passage .
Besides , the door never opened , for I would have heard it . &quot;
&quot; That settles this exit .
Then no doubt the lady went out the way she came .
I understand that this other passage leads only to the Professor &apos;s room .
There is no exit that way ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; We shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the Professor .
Halloa , Hopkins !
this is very important , very important indeed .
The Professor &apos;s corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting . &quot;
&quot; Well , sir , what of that ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you see any bearing upon the case ?
Well , well , I don &apos;t insist upon it .
No doubt I am wrong .
And yet it seems to me to be suggestive .
Come with me and introduce me . &quot;
We passed down the passage , which was of the same length as that which led to the garden .
At the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door .
Our guide knocked , and then ushered us into the Professor &apos;s bedroom .
It was a very large chamber , lined with <unk> volumes , which had <unk> from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners , or were <unk> all round at the base of the cases .
The bed was in the centre of the room , and in it , propped up with <unk> , was the owner of the house .
I have seldom seen a more <unk> person .
It was a gaunt , aquiline face which was turned towards us , with <unk> dark eyes , which <unk> in deep <unk> under overhung and tufted brows .
His hair and beard were white , save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth .
A cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair , and the air of the room was <unk> with stale <unk> .
As he held out his hand to Holmes I perceived that it also was stained yellow with <unk> .
&quot; A smoker , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
said he , speaking <unk> English with a curious little <unk> <unk> .
&quot; Pray take a cigarette .
And you , sir ?
I can recommend them , for I have them especially prepared by <unk> of <unk> .
He <unk> me a thousand at a time , and I grieve to say that I have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight .
Bad , sir , very bad , but an old man has few <unk> .
Tobacco and my <unk> is all that is left to me . &quot;
Holmes had lit a cigarette , and was <unk> little darting <unk> all over the room .
&quot; Tobacco and my work , but now only tobacco , &quot; the old man exclaimed .
&quot; <unk> !
what a fatal <unk> !
Who could have <unk> such a terrible catastrophe ?
So <unk> a young man !
I assure you that after a few months &apos; training he was an admirable assistant .
What do you think of the matter , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; I have not yet made up my mind . &quot;
&quot; I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us .
To a poor <unk> and invalid like myself such a blow is <unk> .
I seem to have lost the <unk> of thought .
But you are a man of <unk> are a man of affairs .
It is part of the <unk> routine of your life .
You can preserve your balance in every emergency .
We are fortunate indeed in having you at our side . &quot;
Holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old Professor was talking .
I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary <unk> .
It was evident that he shared our host &apos;s <unk> for the fresh <unk> cigarettes .
&quot; Yes , sir , it is a crushing blow , &quot; said the old man .
&quot; That is my <unk> <unk> pile of papers on the side table yonder .
It is my analysis of the documents found in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , a work which will cut deep at the very <unk> of revealed <unk> .
With my <unk> health I do not know whether I shall ever be able to complete it now that my assistant has been taken from me .
Dear me , Mr. Holmes ; why , you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself . &quot;
Holmes smiled .
&quot; I am a <unk> , &quot; said he , taking another cigarette from the <unk> <unk> lighting it from the <unk> of that which he had finished .
&quot; I will not trouble you with any lengthy <unk> , Professor Coram , since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it .
I would only ask this .
What do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words : &apos; The Professorit was she &apos; ? &quot;
The Professor shook his head .
&quot; Susan is a country girl , &quot; said he , &quot; and you know the incredible <unk> of that class .
I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent <unk> words , and that she twisted them into this <unk> message . &quot;
&quot; I see .
You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy ? &quot;
&quot; Possibly an accident ; <unk> only <unk> it among <unk> suicide .
Young men have their hidden <unk> affair of the heart , perhaps , which we have never known .
It is a more probable supposition than murder . &quot;
&quot; But the eyeglasses ? &quot;
&quot; Ah !
I am only a <unk> man of dreams .
I cannot explain the practical things of life .
But still , we are aware , my friend , that <unk> may take strange <unk> .
By all means take another cigarette .
It is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so .
A <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> knows what article may be carried as a <unk> or <unk> when a man puts an end to his life ?
This gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass ; but , after all , it is easy to be mistaken on such a point .
As to the knife , it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell .
It is possible that I speak as a child , but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith has met his fate by his own hand . &quot;
Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward , and he continued to walk up and down for some time , lost in thought and <unk> cigarette after cigarette .
&quot; Tell me , Professor Coram , &quot; he said , at last , &quot; what is in that cupboard in the bureau ? &quot;
&quot; Nothing that would help a thief .
<unk> papers , letters from my poor wife , <unk> of <unk> which have done me honour .
Here is the key .
You can look for yourself . &quot;
Holmes picked up the key and looked at it for an instant ; then he handed it back .
&quot; No ; I hardly think that it would help me , &quot; said he .
&quot; I should prefer to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in my head .
There is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward .
We must apologize for having <unk> upon you , Professor Coram , and I promise that we won &apos;t disturb you until after lunch .
At two o &apos;clock we will come again and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval . &quot;
Holmes was curiously <unk> , and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence .
&quot; Have you a clue ? &quot;
I asked , at last .
&quot; It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked , &quot; said he .
&quot; It is possible that I am utterly mistaken .
The cigarettes will show me . &quot;
&quot; My dear Holmes , &quot; I exclaimed , &quot; how on earth &quot; &quot; Well , well , you may see for yourself .
If not , there &apos;s no harm done .
Of course , we always have the optician clue to fall back upon , but I take a short cut when I can get it .
Ah , here is the good Mrs. Marker !
Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her . &quot;
I may have remarked before that Holmes had , when he liked , a peculiarly <unk> way with women , and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them .
In half the time which he had named he had captured the housekeeper &apos;s <unk> , and was <unk> with her as if he had known her for years .
&quot; Yes , Mr. Holmes , it is as you say , sir .
He does smoke something terrible .
All day and sometimes all night , sir .
I &apos;ve seen that room of a <unk> , sir , you &apos;d have thought it was a London <unk> .
Poor young Mr. Smith , he was a smoker also , but not as bad as the Professor .
His <unk> , I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s better nor worse for the smoking . &quot;
&quot; Ah ! &quot;
said Holmes , &quot; but it kills the appetite . &quot;
&quot; Well , I don &apos;t know about that , sir . &quot;
&quot; I suppose the Professor <unk> hardly anything ? &quot;
&quot; Well , he is <unk> .
I &apos;ll say that for him . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll wager he took no breakfast this morning , and won &apos;t face his lunch after all the cigarettes I saw him <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Well , you &apos;re out there , sir , as it happens , for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning .
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ve known him make a better one , and he &apos;s ordered a good dish of <unk> for his lunch .
I &apos;m surprised myself , for since I came into that room yesterday and saw young Mr. Smith lying there on the floor I couldn &apos;t bear to look at food .
Well , it takes all <unk> to make a world , and the Professor hasn &apos;t let it take his appetite away . &quot;
We <unk> the morning away in the garden .
Stanley Hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some <unk> of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the Chatham Road the previous morning .
As to my friend , all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him .
I had never known him handle a case in such a <unk> fashion .
Even the news brought back by Hopkins that he had found the children and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with Holmes &apos;s description , and wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses , failed to rouse any sign of keen interest .
He was more <unk> when Susan , who waited upon us at lunch , <unk> the information that she believed Mr. Smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning , and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred .
I could not myself see the bearing of this incident , but I clearly perceived that Holmes was <unk> it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain .
Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch .
&quot; Two o &apos;clock , gentlemen , &quot; said he .
&quot; We must go up and have it out with our friend the Professor . &quot;
The old man had just finished his lunch , and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had <unk> him .
He was , indeed , a weird figure as he turned his white <unk> and his glowing eyes towards us .
The eternal cigarette <unk> in his mouth .
He had been dressed and was seated in an armchair by the fire .
&quot; Well , Mr. Holmes , have you solved this mystery yet ? &quot;
He <unk> the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion .
Holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment , and between them they <unk> the box over the edge .
For a minute or two we were all on our knees <unk> <unk> cigarettes from impossible places .
When we rose again I observed that Holmes &apos;s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour .
Only at a crisis have I seen those <unk> flying .
&quot; Yes , &quot; said he , &quot; I have solved it . &quot;
Stanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement .
Something like a <unk> <unk> over the gaunt features of the old Professor .
&quot; Indeed !
In the garden ? &quot;
&quot; No , here . &quot;
&quot; Here !
When ? &quot;
&quot; This instant . &quot;
&quot; You are surely joking , Mr. Sherlock Holmes .
You <unk> me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion . &quot;
&quot; I have <unk> and <unk> every link of my chain , Professor Coram , and I am sure that it is sound .
What your motives are or what exact part you play in this strange business I am not yet able to say .
In a few minutes I shall probably hear it from your own lips .
Meanwhile I will reconstruct what is past for your benefit , so that you may know the information which I still require .
&quot; A lady yesterday entered your study .
She came with the intention of <unk> herself of certain documents which were in your bureau .
She had a key of her own .
I have had an opportunity of examining yours , and I do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced .
You were not an <unk> , therefore , and she came , so far as I can read the evidence , without your knowledge to <unk> you . &quot;
The Professor blew a cloud from his lips .
&quot; This is most interesting and instructive , &quot; said he .
&quot; Have you no more to add ?
Surely , having traced this lady so far , you can also say what has become of her . &quot;
&quot; I will endeavour to do so .
In the first place she was seized by your secretary , and stabbed him in order to escape .
This catastrophe I am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident , for I am convinced that the lady had no intention of <unk> so <unk> an injury .
An assassin does not come <unk> .
<unk> by what she had done she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy .
Unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in the scuffle , and as she was extremely <unk> she was really helpless without them .
She ran down a corridor , which she imagined to be that by which she had <unk> were lined with cocoanut <unk> it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage and that her retreat was cut off behind her .
What was she to do ?
She could not go back .
She could not remain where she was .
She must go on .
She went on .
She mounted a stair , pushed open a door , and found herself in your room . &quot;
The old man sat with his mouth open staring wildly at Holmes .
<unk> and fear were stamped upon his expressive features .
Now , with an effort , he shrugged his shoulders and burst into <unk> laughter .
&quot; All very fine , Mr. Holmes , &quot; said he .
&quot; But there is one little flaw in your splendid theory .
I was myself in my room , and I never left it during the day . &quot;
&quot; I am aware of that , Professor Coram . &quot;
&quot; And you mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room ? &quot;
&quot; I never said so .
You were aware of it .
You spoke with her .
You recognised her .
You aided her to escape . &quot;
Again the Professor burst into <unk> laughter .
He had risen to his feet and his eyes glowed like embers .
&quot; You are mad ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; You are talking <unk> .
I helped her to escape ?
Where is she now ? &quot;
&quot; She is there , &quot; said Holmes , and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room .
I saw the old man throw up his arms , a terrible <unk> passed over his grim face , and he fell back in his chair .
At the same instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge , and a woman rushed out into the room .
&quot; You are right ! &quot;
she cried , in a strange foreign voice .
&quot; You are right !
I am here . &quot;
She was brown with the dust and draped with the <unk> which had come from the walls of her hidingplace .
Her face , too , was <unk> with grime , and at the best she could never have been handsome , for she had the exact physical characteristics which Holmes had <unk> , with , in addition , a long and obstinate chin .
What with her natural <unk> , and what with the change from dark to light , she stood as one dazed , blinking about her to see where and who we were .
And yet , in spite of all these <unk> , there was a certain <unk> in the woman &apos;s bearing , a <unk> in the defiant chin and in the upraised head , which compelled something of respect and admiration .
Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and <unk> her as his prisoner , but she <unk> him aside gently , and yet with an overmastering dignity which compelled <unk> .
The old man lay back in his chair , with a twitching face , and stared at her with brooding eyes .
&quot; Yes , sir , I am your prisoner , &quot; she said .
&quot; From where I stood I could hear everything , and I know that you have learned the truth .
I confess it all .
It was I who killed the young man .
But you are right , you who say it was an accident .
I did not even know that it was a knife which I held in my hand , for in my despair I snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go .
It is the truth that I tell . &quot;
&quot; Madam , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; I am sure that it is the truth .
I fear that you are far from well . &quot;
She had turned a dreadful colour , the more ghastly under the dark <unk> upon her face .
She seated herself on the side of the bed ; then she resumed .
&quot; I have only a little time here , &quot; she said , &quot; but I would have you to know the whole truth .
I am this man &apos;s wife .
He is not an Englishman .
He is a Russian .
His name I will not tell . &quot;
For the first time the old man stirred .
&quot; God bless you , Anna ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; God bless you ! &quot;
She cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction .
&quot; Why should you <unk> so hard to that wretched life of yours , Sergius ? &quot;
said she .
&quot; It has done harm to many and good to <unk> even to yourself .
However , it is not for me to cause the frail <unk> to be snapped before God &apos;s time .
I have enough already upon my soul since I crossed the threshold of this cursed house .
But I must speak or I shall be too late .
&quot; I have said , gentlemen , that I am this man &apos;s wife .
He was fifty and I a foolish girl of twenty when we married .
It was in a city of <unk> , a <unk> will not name the place . &quot;
&quot; God bless you , Anna ! &quot;
murmured the old man again .
&quot; We were <unk> , you understand .
He and I and many more .
Then there came a time of trouble , a police officer was killed , many were arrested , evidence was wanted , and in order to save his own life and to <unk> a great reward my husband betrayed his own wife and his <unk> .
Yes , we were all arrested upon his confession .
Some of us found our way to the gallows and some to Siberia .
I was among these last , but my term was not for life .
My husband came to England with his illgotten gains , and has lived in quiet ever since , knowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done . &quot;
The old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette .
&quot; I am in your hands , Anna , &quot; said he .
&quot; You were always good to me . &quot;
&quot; I have not yet told you the height of his villainy , &quot; said she .
&quot; <unk> our <unk> of the Order there was one who was the friend of my heart .
He was noble , unselfish , <unk> that my husband was not .
He hated violence .
We were all <unk> that is <unk> he was not .
He wrote for ever <unk> us from such a course .
These letters would have saved him .
So would my diary , in which from day to day I had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken .
My husband found and kept both diary and letters .
He hid them , and he tried hard to swear away the young man &apos;s life .
In this he failed , but Alexis was sent a <unk> to Siberia , where now , at this moment , he works in a <unk> mine .
Think of that , you villain , you villain ; now , now , at this very moment , Alexis , a man whose name you are not worthy to speak , works and lives like a <unk> , and yet I have your life in my hands and I let you go . &quot;
&quot; You were always a noble woman , Anna , &quot; said the old man , puffing at his cigarette .
She had risen , but she fell back again with a little cry of pain .
&quot; I must finish , &quot; she said .
&quot; When my term was over I set myself to get the diary and letters which , if sent to the Russian Government , would <unk> my friend &apos;s release .
I knew that my husband had come to England .
After months of searching I discovered where he was .
I knew that he still had the diary , for when I was in Siberia I had a letter from him once <unk> me and <unk> some passages from its pages .
Yet I was sure that with his <unk> nature he would never give it to me of his own free will .
I must get it for myself .
With this object I engaged an agent from a private detective firm , who entered my husband &apos;s house as <unk> was your second secretary , Sergius , the one who left you so hurriedly .
He found that papers were kept in the cupboard , and he got an impression of the key .
He would not go farther .
He furnished me with a plan of the house , and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty , as the secretary was employed up here .
So at last I took my courage in both hands and I came down to get the papers for myself .
I succeeded , but at what a cost !
&quot; I had just taken the papers and was <unk> the cupboard when the young man seized me .
I had seen him already that morning .
He had met me in the road and I had asked him to tell me where Professor Coram lived , not knowing that he was in his employ . &quot;
&quot; Exactly !
exactly ! &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; The secretary came back and told his employer of the woman he had met .
Then in his last breath he tried to send a message that it was <unk> she whom he had just <unk> with him . &quot;
&quot; You must let me speak , &quot; said the woman , in an <unk> voice , and her face contracted as if in pain .
&quot; When he had fallen I rushed from the room , chose the wrong door , and found myself in my husband &apos;s room .
He spoke of giving me up .
I showed him that if he did so his life was in my hands .
If he gave me to the law I could give him to the Brotherhood .
It was not that I wished to live for my own sake , but it was that I desired to <unk> my purpose .
He knew that I would do what I <unk> his own fate was involved in mine .
For that reason and for no other he <unk> me .
He thrust me into that dark hidingplace , a <unk> of old days , known only to himself .
He took his meals in his own room , and so was able to give me part of his food .
It was agreed that when the police left the house I should slip away by night and come back no more .
But in some way you have read our plans . &quot;
She tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet .
&quot; These are my last words , &quot; said she ; &quot; here is the packet which will save Alexis .
I confide it to your honour and to your love of justice .
Take it !
You will <unk> it at the Russian Embassy .
Now I have done my duty , and &quot; &quot; Stop her ! &quot;
cried Holmes .
He had bounded across the room and had <unk> a small <unk> from her hand .
&quot; Too late ! &quot;
she said , sinking back on the bed .
&quot; Too late !
I took the <unk> before I left my hidingplace .
My head <unk> !
I am going !
I charge you , sir , to remember the packet . &quot;
&quot; A simple case , and yet in some ways an instructive one , &quot; Holmes remarked , as we travelled back to town .
&quot; It hinged from the outset upon the pincenez .
But for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these I am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution .
It was clear to me from the strength of the glasses that the <unk> must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them .
When you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step I remarked , as you may remember , that it was a <unk> performance .
In my mind I set it down as an impossible performance , save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses .
I was forced , therefore , to seriously consider the hypothesis that she had remained within the house .
On perceiving the <unk> of the two corridors it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake , and in that case it was evident that she must have entered the Professor &apos;s room .
I was keenly on the alert , therefore , for whatever would bear out this supposition , and I examined the room <unk> for anything in the shape of a hidingplace .
The carpet seemed continuous and firmly <unk> , so I dismissed the idea of a <unk> .
There might well be a <unk> behind the books .
As you are aware , such devices are common in old <unk> .
I observed that books were <unk> on the floor at all other points , but that one bookcase was left clear .
This , then , might be the door .
I could see no marks to guide me , but the carpet was of a <unk> colour , which <unk> itself very well to examination .
I therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes , and I dropped the ash all over the <unk> in front of the suspected bookcase .
It was a simple trick , but exceedingly effective .
I then went downstairs and I ascertained , in your presence , Watson , without your perceiving the <unk> of my remarks , that Professor Coram &apos;s consumption of food had <unk> one would expect when he is <unk> a second person .
We then <unk> to the room again , when , by <unk> the cigarettebox , I obtained a very excellent view of the floor , and was able to see quite clearly , from the traces upon the cigarette ash , that the prisoner had , in our absence , come out from her retreat .
Well , Hopkins , here we are at Charing Cross , and I congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion .
You are going to headquarters , no doubt .
I think , Watson , you and I will drive together to the Russian Embassy . &quot;
We were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker Street , but I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy <unk> morning some seven or eight years ago and gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour .
It was addressed to him , and ran thus : &quot; <unk> <unk> me .
<unk> misfortune .
Right wing threequarter missing ; <unk> tomorrow .
Overton . &quot;
&quot; Strand <unk> and dispatched <unk> , &quot; said Holmes , reading it over and over .
&quot; Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it , and somewhat incoherent in consequence .
Well , well , he will be here , I dare say , by the time I have looked through the times , and then we shall know all about it .
Even the most <unk> problem would be welcome in these <unk> days . &quot;
Things had indeed been very <unk> with us , and I had learned to dread such periods of inaction , for I knew by experience that my companion &apos;s brain was so <unk> active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work .
For years I had gradually <unk> him from that <unk> mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career .
Now I knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer <unk> for this <unk> <unk> , but I was well aware that the fiend was not dead , but sleeping ; and I have known that the sleep was a light one and the <unk> near when in periods of <unk> I have seen the drawn look upon Holmes &apos;s ascetic face , and the brooding of his deepset and inscrutable eyes .
Therefore I blessed this Mr. Overton , whoever he might be , since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm which brought more <unk> to my friend than all the <unk> of his tempestuous life .
As we had expected , the telegram was soon followed by its sender , and the card of Mr. Cyril Overton , of Trinity College , Cambridge , announced the arrival of an enormous young man , sixteen stone of solid bone and <unk> , who <unk> the doorway with his broad shoulders and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with anxiety .
&quot; Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? &quot;
My companion bowed .
&quot; I &apos;ve been down to Scotland Yard , Mr. Holmes .
I saw Inspector Stanley Hopkins .
He advised me to come to you .
He said the case , so far as he could see , was more in your line than in that of the regular police . &quot;
&quot; Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s awful , Mr. Holmes , simply awful !
I wonder my hair isn &apos;t grey .
Godfrey <unk> &apos;ve heard of him , of course ?
He &apos;s simply the hinge that the whole team turns on .
I &apos;d rather spare two from the pack and have Godfrey for my threequarter line .
Whether it &apos;s passing , or <unk> , or <unk> , there &apos;s no one to touch him ; and then , he &apos;s got the head and can hold us all together .
What am I to do ?
That &apos;s what I ask you , Mr. Holmes .
There &apos;s <unk> , first reserve , but he is trained as a half , and he always edges right in on to the <unk> instead of keeping out on the <unk> .
He &apos;s a fine <unk> , it &apos;s true , but , then , he has no judgment , and he can &apos;t <unk> for <unk> .
Why , Morton or <unk> , the Oxford <unk> , could <unk> round him .
<unk> is fast enough , but he couldn &apos;t drop from the twentyfive line , and a threequarter who can &apos;t either <unk> or drop isn &apos;t worth a place for pace alone .
No , Mr. Holmes , we are done unless you can help me to find Godfrey Staunton . &quot;
My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech , which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness , every point being driven home by the <unk> of a <unk> hand upon the <unk> &apos;s knee .
When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out his hand and took down letter &quot; S &quot; of his commonplace book .
For once he dug in vain into that mine of <unk> information .
&quot; There is Arthur <unk> Staunton , the rising young forger , &quot; said he , &quot; and there was <unk> Staunton , whom I helped to hang , but Godfrey Staunton is a new name to me . &quot;
It was our visitor &apos;s turn to look surprised .
&quot; Why , Mr. Holmes , I thought you knew things , &quot; said he .
&quot; I suppose , then , if you have never heard of Godfrey Staunton you don &apos;t know Cyril Overton either ? &quot;
Holmes shook his head goodhumouredly .
&quot; Great <unk> ! &quot;
cried the athlete .
&quot; Why , I was first reserve for England against Wales , and I &apos;ve <unk> the &apos; Varsity all this year .
But that &apos;s nothing !
I didn &apos;t think there was a soul in England who didn &apos;t know Godfrey Staunton , the crack threequarter , Cambridge , Blackheath , and five <unk> .
Good Lord !
Mr. Holmes , where have you lived ? &quot;
Holmes laughed at the young <unk> &apos;s <unk> astonishment .
&quot; You live in a different world to me , Mr. Overton , a <unk> and <unk> one .
My <unk> stretch out into many sections of society , but never , I am happy to say , into amateur sport , which is the best and <unk> thing in England .
However , your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do ; so now , my good sir , I beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and quietly exactly what it is that has occurred , and how you desire that I should help you . &quot;
Young Overton &apos;s face <unk> the bothered look of the man who is more accustomed to using his <unk> than his wits ; but by <unk> , with many <unk> and <unk> which I may <unk> from his narrative , he laid his strange story before us .
&quot; It &apos;s this way , Mr. Holmes .
As I have said , I am the skipper of the <unk> team of Cambridge &apos; Varsity , and Godfrey Staunton is my best man .
Tomorrow we play Oxford .
Yesterday we all came up and we settled at <unk> &apos;s private hotel .
At ten o &apos;clock I went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to <unk> , for I believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit .
I had a word or two with Godfrey before he turned in .
He seemed to me to be pale and bothered .
I asked him what was the matter .
He said he was all <unk> a touch of <unk> .
I bade him goodnight and left him .
Half an hour later the porter tells me that a roughlooking man with a beard called with a note for Godfrey .
He had not gone to bed and the note was taken to his room .
Godfrey read it and fell back in a chair as if he had been <unk> .
The porter was so scared that he was going to <unk> me , but Godfrey stopped him , had a drink of water , and pulled himself together .
Then he went downstairs , said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall , and the two of them went off together .
The last that the porter saw of them , they were almost running down the street in the direction of the Strand .
This morning Godfrey &apos;s room was empty , his bed had never been slept in , and his things were all just as I had seen them the night before .
He had gone off at a moment &apos;s notice with this stranger , and no word has come from him since .
I don &apos;t believe he will ever come back .
He was a <unk> , was Godfrey , down to his <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him .
No ; I feel as if he were gone for good and we should never see him again . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular narrative .
&quot; What did you do ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there .
I have had an answer .
No one has seen him . &quot;
&quot; Could he have got back to Cambridge ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , there is a late <unk> eleven . &quot;
&quot; But so far as you can ascertain he did not take it ? &quot;
&quot; No , he has not been seen . &quot;
&quot; What did you do next ? &quot;
&quot; I wired to Lord MountJames . &quot;
&quot; Why to Lord MountJames ? &quot;
&quot; Godfrey is an <unk> , and Lord MountJames is his nearest <unk> uncle , I believe . &quot;
&quot; Indeed .
This <unk> new light upon the matter .
Lord MountJames is one of the richest men in England . &quot;
&quot; So I &apos;ve heard Godfrey say . &quot;
&quot; And your friend was closely <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , he was his heir , and the old boy is nearly <unk> full of <unk> , too .
They say he could chalk his <unk> with his <unk> .
He never allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life , for he is an absolute miser , but it will all come to him right enough . &quot;
&quot; Have you heard from Lord MountJames ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; What motive could your friend have in going to Lord MountJames ? &quot;
&quot; Well , something was <unk> him the night before , and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative who had so much of it , though from all I have heard he would not have much chance of getting it .
Godfrey was not fond of the old man .
He would not go if he could help it . &quot;
&quot; Well , we can soon <unk> that .
If your friend was going to his relative , Lord MountJames , you have then to explain the visit of this roughlooking fellow at so late an hour , and the agitation that was caused by his coming . &quot;
Cyril Overton pressed his hands to his head .
&quot; I can make nothing of it , &quot; said he .
&quot; Well , well , I have a clear day , and I shall be happy to look into the matter , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman .
It must , as you say , have been an <unk> necessity which tore him away in such a fashion , and the same necessity is likely to hold him away .
Let us step round together to this hotel , and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes was a <unk> in the art of putting a humble witness at his <unk> , and very soon , in the <unk> of Godfrey Staunton &apos;s <unk> room , he had extracted all that the porter had to tell .
The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman , neither was he a working man .
He was simply what the porter described as a &quot; <unk> chap &quot; ; a man of fifty , beard grizzled , pale face , quietly dressed .
He seemed himself to be agitated .
The porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note .
Godfrey Staunton had <unk> the note into his pocket .
Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall .
They had exchanged a few sentences , of which the porter had only distinguished the one word &quot; time . &quot;
Then they had hurried off in the manner described .
It was just halfpast ten by the hall <unk> .
&quot; Let me see , &quot; said Holmes , <unk> himself on Staunton &apos;s bed .
&quot; You are the day porter , are you not ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; I go off duty at eleven . &quot;
&quot; The night porter saw nothing , I suppose ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; one theatre party came in late .
No one else . &quot;
&quot; Were you on duty all day yesterday ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; Did you take any messages to Mr.
Staunton ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; one telegram . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
that &apos;s interesting .
What o &apos;clock was this ? &quot;
&quot; About six . &quot;
&quot; Where was Mr. Staunton when he received it ? &quot;
&quot; Here in his room . &quot;
&quot; Were you present when he opened it ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; I waited to see if there was an answer . &quot;
&quot; Well , was there ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
He wrote an answer . &quot;
&quot; Did you take it ? &quot;
&quot; No ; he took it himself . &quot;
&quot; But he wrote it in your presence ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir .
I was standing by the door , and he with his back turned at that table .
When he had written it he said , &apos; All right , porter , I will take this myself . &apos; &quot;
&quot; What did he write it with ? &quot;
&quot; A pen , sir . &quot;
&quot; Was the <unk> form one of these on the table ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; it was the top one . &quot;
Holmes rose .
<unk> the forms he carried them over to the window and carefully examined that which was <unk> .
&quot; It is a pity he did not write in pencil , &quot; said he , throwing them down again with a <unk> of disappointment .
&quot; As you have no doubt frequently observed , Watson , the impression usually goes <unk> fact which has <unk> many a happy marriage .
However , I can find no trace here .
I rejoice , however , to perceive that he wrote with a <unk> <unk> pen , and I can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this <unk> .
Ah , yes , surely this is the very thing ! &quot;
He tore off a strip of the <unk> and turned towards us the following <unk> : Picture : Several <unk> <unk> on paper Cyril Overton was much excited .
&quot; Hold it to the glass ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; That is unnecessary , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; The paper is thin , and the reverse will give the message .
Here it is . &quot;
He turned it over and we read : Picture : Stand by us for God <unk> <unk> sake !
&quot; So that is the tail end of the telegram which Godfrey Staunton dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance .
There are at least six words of the message which have escaped us ; but what remains <unk> by us for God &apos;s sake !
<unk> that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him , and from which someone else could <unk> him .
<unk> , &apos; mark you !
Another person was involved .
Who should it be but the <unk> , bearded man , who seemed himself in so nervous a state ?
What , then , is the connection between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded man ?
And what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger ?
Our inquiry has already <unk> down to that . &quot;
&quot; We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed , &quot; I suggested .
&quot; Exactly , my dear Watson .
Your reflection , though profound , had already crossed my mind .
But I dare say it may have come to your notice that if you walk into a postoffice and demand to see the counterfoil of another man &apos;s message there may be some <unk> on the part of the officials to <unk> you .
There is so much red <unk> in these matters !
However , I have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained .
Meanwhile , I should like in your presence , Mr. Overton , to go through these papers which have been left upon the table . &quot;
There were a number of letters , <unk> , and <unk> , which Holmes turned over and examined with quick , nervous fingers and darting , penetrating eyes .
&quot; Nothing here , &quot; he said , at last .
&quot; By the way , I suppose your friend was a healthy young <unk> amiss with him ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> as a bell . &quot;
&quot; Have you ever known him ill ? &quot;
&quot; Not a day .
He has been laid up with a <unk> , and once he slipped his <unk> , but that was nothing . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose .
I should think he may have had some secret trouble .
With your assent I will put one or two of these papers in my pocket , in case they should bear upon our future inquiry . &quot;
&quot; One moment !
one moment ! &quot;
cried a <unk> voice , and we looked up to find a queer little old man , <unk> and twitching in the doorway .
He was dressed in <unk> black , with a very broad <unk> <unk> and a loose white <unk> whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or of an <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Yet , in spite of his <unk> and even absurd appearance , his voice had a sharp <unk> , and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention .
&quot; Who are you , sir , and by what right do you touch this gentleman &apos;s papers ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; I am a private detective , and I am endeavouring to explain his disappearance . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you are , are you ?
And who instructed you , eh ? &quot;
&quot; This gentleman , Mr. Staunton &apos;s friend , was referred to me by Scotland Yard . &quot;
&quot; Who are you , sir ? &quot;
&quot; I am Cyril Overton . &quot;
&quot; Then it is you who sent me a telegram .
My name is Lord MountJames .
I came round as quickly as the <unk> &apos; <unk> would bring me .
So you have instructed a detective ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; And are you prepared to meet the cost ? &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt , sir , that my friend Godfrey , when we find him , will be prepared to do that . &quot;
&quot; But if he is never found , eh ?
<unk> me that ! &quot;
&quot; In that case no doubt his family &quot; &quot; Nothing of the sort , sir ! &quot;
screamed the little man .
&quot; Don &apos;t look to me for a <unk> a penny !
You understand that , Mr. Detective !
I am all the family that this young man has got , and I tell you that I am not responsible .
If he has any <unk> it is due to the fact that I have never wasted money , and I do not propose to begin to do so now .
As to those papers with which you are making so free , I may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them . &quot;
&quot; Very good , sir , &quot; said Sherlock Holmes .
&quot; May I ask in the meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man &apos;s disappearance ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , I have not .
He is big enough and old enough to look after himself , and if he is so foolish as to lose himself I entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him . &quot;
&quot; I quite understand your position , &quot; said Holmes , with a <unk> twinkle in his eyes .
&quot; Perhaps you don &apos;t quite understand mine .
Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor man .
If he has been kidnapped it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses .
The fame of your wealth has gone abroad , Lord MountJames , and it is entirely possible that a gang of <unk> have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house , your habits , and your treasure . &quot;
The face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his <unk> .
&quot; Heavens , sir , what an idea !
I never thought of such villainy !
What <unk> rogues there are in the world !
But Godfrey is a fine <unk> staunch lad .
Nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away .
I &apos;ll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening .
In the meantime spare no pains , Mr. Detective !
I beg you to leave no stone <unk> to bring him safely back .
As to money , well , so far as a <unk> , or even a <unk> , goes , you can always look to me . &quot;
Even in his <unk> frame of mind the noble miser could give us no information which could help us , for he knew little of the private life of his nephew .
Our only clue lay in the <unk> telegram , and with a copy of this in his hand Holmes set forth to find a second link for his chain .
We had shaken off Lord MountJames , and Overton had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had <unk> them .
There was a <unk> at a short distance from the hotel .
We halted outside it .
&quot; It &apos;s worth trying , Watson , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Of course , with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils , but we have not reached that stage yet .
I don &apos;t suppose they remember faces in so busy a place .
Let us venture it . &quot;
&quot; I am sorry to trouble you , &quot; said he , in his blandest manner , to the young woman behind the <unk> ; &quot; there is some small mistake about a telegram I sent yesterday .
I have had no answer , and I very much fear that I must have <unk> to put my name at the end .
Could you tell me if this was so ? &quot;
The young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils .
&quot; What o &apos;clock was it ? &quot;
she asked .
&quot; A little after six . &quot;
&quot; Whom was it to ? &quot;
Holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me .
&quot; The last words in it were &apos; for God &apos;s sake , &apos; &quot; he whispered , confidentially ; &quot; I am very anxious at getting no answer . &quot;
The young woman separated one of the forms .
&quot; This is it .
There is no name , &quot; said she , <unk> it out upon the counter .
&quot; Then that , of course , accounts for my getting no answer , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Dear me , how very <unk> of me , to be sure !
Good morning , miss , and many thanks for having relieved my mind . &quot;
He chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
I asked .
&quot; We progress , my dear Watson , we progress .
I had seven different <unk> for getting a glimpse of that telegram , but I could hardly hope to succeed the very first time . &quot;
&quot; And what have you gained ? &quot;
&quot; A startingpoint for our investigation . &quot;
He <unk> a cab .
&quot; King &apos;s Cross Station , &quot; said he .
&quot; We have a journey , then ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; I think we must run down to Cambridge together .
All the indications seem to me to point in that direction . &quot;
&quot; Tell me , &quot; I asked , as we rattled up <unk> &apos;s Inn Road , &quot; have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance ?
I don &apos;t think that among all our cases I have known one where the motives are more obscure .
Surely you don &apos;t really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle ? &quot;
&quot; I confess , my dear Watson , that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation .
It struck me , however , as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person . &quot;
&quot; It certainly did that .
But what are your <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; I could mention several .
You must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the <unk> of this important match , and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side .
It may , of course , be coincidence , but it is interesting .
<unk> sport is free from betting , but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public , and it is possible that it might be worth someone &apos;s while to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a <unk> .
There is one explanation .
A second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property , however modest his means may at present be , and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; These theories take no account of the telegram . &quot;
&quot; Quite true , Watson .
The telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal , and we must not permit our attention to <unk> away from it .
It is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge .
The path of our investigation is at present obscure , but I shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a considerable advance along it . &quot;
It was already dark when we reached the old University city .
Holmes took a cab at the station , and ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr. Leslie Armstrong .
A few minutes later we had stopped at a large mansion in the <unk> thoroughfare .
We were shown in , and after a long wait were at last admitted into the consultingroom , where we found the doctor seated behind his table .
It <unk> the <unk> in which I had lost touch with my profession that the name of Leslie Armstrong was unknown to me .
Now I am aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school of the University , but a thinker of European reputation in more than one branch of <unk> .
Yet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance at the man , the square , massive face , the brooding eyes under the <unk> brows , and the granite moulding of the <unk> jaw .
A man of deep character , a man with an alert mind , grim , ascetic , selfcontained , <unk> I read Dr. Leslie Armstrong .
He held my friend &apos;s card in his hand , and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his <unk> features .
&quot; I have heard your name , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , and I am aware of your profession , one of which I by no means <unk> . &quot;
&quot; In that , doctor , you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country , &quot; said my friend , quietly .
&quot; So far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime , sir , they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community , though I cannot doubt that the official <unk> is <unk> sufficient for the purpose .
Where your <unk> is more open to <unk> is when you <unk> into the secrets of private <unk> , when you <unk> up family matters which are better hidden , and when you <unk> waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself .
At the present moment , for example , I should be writing a treatise instead of <unk> with you . &quot;
&quot; No doubt , doctor ; and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise .
<unk> I may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very <unk> blame , and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police .
You may look upon me simply as an irregular <unk> who goes in front of the regular forces of the country .
I have come to ask you about Mr. Godfrey Staunton . &quot;
&quot; What about him ? &quot;
&quot; You know him , do you not ? &quot;
&quot; He is an intimate friend of mine . &quot;
&quot; You are aware that he has disappeared ? &quot;
&quot; Ah , indeed ! &quot;
There was no change of expression in the <unk> features of the doctor .
&quot; He left his hotel last night .
He has not been heard of . &quot;
&quot; No doubt he will return . &quot;
&quot; Tomorrow is the &apos; Varsity football match . &quot;
&quot; I have no sympathy with these childish <unk> .
The young man &apos;s fate interests me deeply , since I know him and like him .
The football match does not come within my horizon at all . &quot;
&quot; I claim your sympathy , then , in my investigation of Mr. Staunton &apos;s fate .
Do you know where he is ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly not . &quot;
&quot; You have not seen him since yesterday ? &quot;
&quot; No , I have not . &quot;
&quot; Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Did you ever know him ill ? &quot;
&quot; Never . &quot;
Holmes <unk> a sheet of paper before the doctor &apos;s eyes .
&quot; Then perhaps you will explain this <unk> bill for <unk> <unk> , paid by Mr. Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Armstrong of Cambridge .
I picked it out from among the papers upon his desk . &quot;
The doctor flushed with anger .
&quot; I do not feel that there is any reason why I should <unk> an explanation to you , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
Holmes replaced the bill in his notebook .
&quot; If you prefer a public explanation it must come sooner or later , &quot; said he .
&quot; I have already told you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to publish , and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence . &quot;
&quot; I know nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in London ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly not . &quot;
&quot; Dear me , dear me ; the postoffice again ! &quot;
Holmes <unk> , wearily .
&quot; A most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from London by Godfrey Staunton at <unk> yesterday eveninga telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his <unk> yet you have not had it .
It is most culpable .
I shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint . &quot;
Dr. Leslie Armstrong sprang up from behind his desk , and his dark face was crimson with fury .
&quot; I &apos;ll trouble you to walk out of my house , sir , &quot; said he .
&quot; You can tell your employer , Lord MountJames , that I do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents .
No , sir , not another word ! &quot;
He rang the bell furiously .
&quot; John , show these gentlemen out ! &quot;
A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door , and we found ourselves in the street .
Holmes burst out laughing .
&quot; Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character , &quot; said he .
&quot; I have not seen a man who , if he turned his <unk> that way , was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious Moriarty .
And now , my poor Watson , here we are , stranded and <unk> in this <unk> town , which we cannot leave without <unk> our case .
This little inn just opposite Armstrong &apos;s house is singularly adapted to our needs .
If you would engage a front room and <unk> the <unk> for the night , I may have time to make a few inquiries . &quot;
These few inquiries proved , however , to be a more lengthy proceeding than Holmes had imagined , for he did not return to the inn until nearly nine o &apos;clock .
He was pale and <unk> , stained with dust , and exhausted with hunger and fatigue .
A cold supper was ready upon the table , and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe <unk> he was ready to take that half <unk> and <unk> <unk> view which was natural to him when his affairs were going <unk> .
The sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window .
A brougham and pair of <unk> under the glare of a <unk> stood before the doctor &apos;s door .
&quot; It &apos;s been out three hours , &quot; said Holmes ; &quot; started at halfpast six , and here it is back again .
That gives a <unk> of ten or twelve miles , and he does it once , or sometimes twice , a day . &quot;
&quot; No unusual thing for a doctor in practice . &quot;
&quot; But Armstrong is not really a doctor in practice .
He is a lecturer and a <unk> , but he does not care for general practice , which <unk> him from his literary work .
Why , then , does he make these long journeys , which must be exceedingly <unk> to him , and who is it that he visits ? &quot;
&quot; His coachman &quot; &quot; My dear Watson , can you doubt that it was to him that I first applied ?
I do not know whether it came from his own <unk> <unk> or from the <unk> of his master , but he was rude enough to set a dog at me .
Neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick , however , and the matter fell through .
<unk> were strained after that , and further inquiries out of the question .
All that I have learned I got from a friendly <unk> in the yard of our own inn .
It was he who told me of the doctor &apos;s habits and of his daily journey .
At that instant , to give point to his words , the carriage came round to the door . &quot;
&quot; Could you not follow it ? &quot;
&quot; Excellent , Watson !
You are <unk> this evening .
The idea did cross my mind .
There is , as you may have observed , a bicycle shop next to our inn .
Into this I rushed , engaged a bicycle , and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight .
I rapidly <unk> it , and then , keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so , I followed its lights until we were clear of the town .
We had got well out on the country road when a somewhat <unk> incident occurred .
The carriage stopped , the doctor alighted , walked swiftly back to where I had also halted , and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow , and that he hoped his carriage did not <unk> the passage of my bicycle .
Nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it .
I at once rode past the carriage , and , keeping to the main road , I went on for a few miles , and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed .
There was no sign of it , however , and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads which I had observed .
I rode back , but again saw nothing of the carriage , and now , as you perceive , it has returned after me .
Of course , I had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton , and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of interest to us ; but , now that I find he keeps so keen a lookout upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions , the affair appears more important , and I shall not be satisfied until I have made the matter clear . &quot;
&quot; We can follow him tomorrow . &quot;
&quot; Can we ?
It is not so easy as you seem to think .
You are not familiar with <unk> <unk> , are you ?
It does not lend itself to concealment .
All this country that I passed over tonight is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand , and the man we are following is no fool , as he very clearly showed tonight .
I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London developments at this address , and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong , whose name the <unk> young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton &apos;s urgent message .
He knows where the young man <unk> that I &apos;ll <unk> if he knows , then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also .
At present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession , and , as you are aware , Watson , it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition . &quot;
And yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the mystery .
A note was handed in after breakfast , which Holmes passed across to me with a smile .
Sir it ran : I can assure you that you are <unk> your time in <unk> my movements .
I have , as you discovered last night , a window at the back of my brougham , and if you desire a <unk> ride which will lead you to the spot from which you started , you have only to follow me .
Meanwhile , I can inform you that no <unk> upon me can in any way help Mr. Godfrey Staunton , and I am convinced that the best service you can do to that gentleman is to return at once to London and to report to your employer that you are unable to trace him .
Your time in Cambridge will certainly be wasted .
Yours faithfully , Leslie Armstrong .
&quot; An <unk> , honest <unk> is the doctor , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Well , well , he <unk> my curiosity , and I must really know more before I leave him . &quot;
&quot; His carriage is at his door now , &quot; said I.
&quot; There he is <unk> into it .
I saw him glance up at our window as he did so .
Suppose I try my luck upon the bicycle ? &quot;
&quot; No , no , my dear Watson !
With all respect for your natural <unk> I do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor .
I think that possibly I can attain our end by some <unk> explorations of my own .
I am afraid that I must leave you to your own devices , as the appearance of two inquiring strangers upon a <unk> countryside might excite more gossip than I care for .
No doubt you will find some sights to <unk> you in this venerable city , and I hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening . &quot;
Once more , however , my friend was destined to be disappointed .
He came back at night weary and <unk> .
&quot; I have had a blank day , Watson .
Having got the doctor &apos;s general direction , I spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of Cambridge , and <unk> notes with <unk> and other local news <unk> .
I have covered some ground : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have each been <unk> and have each proved disappointing .
The daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such <unk> <unk> .
The doctor has scored once more .
Is there a telegram for me ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; I opened it .
Here it is : &quot; &apos; Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon , Trinity College . &apos;
&quot; I don &apos;t understand it . &quot;
&quot; Oh , it is clear enough .
It is from our friend Overton , and is in answer to a question from me .
I &apos;ll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon , and then I have no doubt that our luck will turn .
By the way , is there any news of the match ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last <unk> .
Oxford won by a goal and two tries .
The last sentences of the description say : &quot; &apos; The defeat of the <unk> <unk> may be entirely <unk> to the unfortunate absence of the crack <unk> , Godfrey Staunton , whose want was felt at every instant of the game .
The lack of combination in the threequarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence more than <unk> the efforts of a heavy and hardworking pack . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Then our friend Overton &apos;s <unk> have been justified , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; <unk> I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong , and football does not come within my horizon .
<unk> to bed tonight , Watson , for I foresee that tomorrow may be an <unk> day . &quot;
I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning , for he sat by the fire holding his tiny <unk> syringe .
I associated that instrument with the single weakness of his nature , and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand .
He laughed at my expression of dismay , and laid it upon the table .
&quot; No , no , my dear fellow , there is no cause for alarm .
It is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil , but it will rather prove to be the key which will <unk> our mystery .
On this syringe I base all my hopes .
I have just returned from a small <unk> expedition and everything is favourable .
<unk> a good breakfast , Watson , for I propose to get upon Dr. Armstrong &apos;s trail today , and once on it I will not stop for rest or food until I run him to his burrow . &quot;
&quot; In that case , &quot; said I , &quot; we had best carry our breakfast with us , for he is making an early start .
His carriage is at the door . &quot;
&quot; Never mind .
Let him go .
He will be clever if he can drive where I cannot follow him .
When you have finished come downstairs with me , and I will introduce you to a detective who is a very <unk> specialist in the work that lies before us . &quot;
When we descended I followed Holmes into the stable yard , where he opened the door of a <unk> and led out a squat , <unk> , <unk> dog , something between a <unk> and a <unk> .
&quot; Let me introduce you to Pompey , &quot; said he .
&quot; Pompey is the pride of the local <unk> , no very great <unk> , as his build will show , but a staunch hound on a scent .
Well , Pompey , you may not be fast , but I expect you will be too fast for a couple of middleaged London gentlemen , so I will take the liberty of <unk> this leather leash to your collar .
Now , boy , come along , and show what you can do . &quot;
He led him across to the doctor &apos;s door .
The dog <unk> round for an instant , and then with a shrill <unk> of excitement started off down the street , tugging at his leash in his efforts to go <unk> .
In half an hour , we were clear of the town and <unk> down a country road .
&quot; What have you done , Holmes ? &quot;
I asked .
&quot; A <unk> and venerable device , but useful upon occasion .
I walked into the doctor &apos;s yard this morning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel .
A <unk> will follow aniseed from here to John o &apos; <unk> &apos;s , and our friend Armstrong would have to drive through the <unk> before he would shake Pompey off his trail .
Oh , the cunning rascal !
This is how he gave me the slip the other night . &quot;
The dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a <unk> lane .
Half a mile farther this opened into another broad road , and the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town , which we had just <unk> .
The road took a sweep to the south of the town and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we started .
&quot; This <unk> has been entirely for our benefit , then ? &quot;
said Holmes .
&quot; No wonder that my inquiries among those villages led to nothing .
The doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth , and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception .
This should be the village of Trumpington to the right of us .
And , by Jove !
here is the brougham coming round the corner .
Quick , Watson , quick , or we are done ! &quot;
He sprang through a gate into a field , <unk> the <unk> Pompey after him .
We had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage rattled past .
I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong within , his shoulders bowed , his head sunk on his hands , the very image of distress .
I could tell by my companion &apos;s graver face that he also had seen .
&quot; I fear there is some dark ending to our quest , &quot; said he .
&quot; It cannot be long before we know it .
Come , Pompey !
Ah , it is the cottage in the field ! &quot;
There could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey .
Pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate where the marks of the brougham &apos;s wheels were still to be seen .
A footpath led across to the lonely cottage .
Holmes tied the dog to the hedge , and we hastened onwards .
My friend knocked at the little rustic door , and knocked again without response .
And yet the cottage was not deserted , for a low sound came to our <unk> kind of <unk> of misery and despair , which was <unk> melancholy .
Holmes paused <unk> , and then he glanced back at the road which we had just traversed .
A brougham was coming down it , and there could be no mistaking those grey horses .
&quot; By Jove , the doctor is coming back ! &quot;
cried Holmes .
&quot; That settles it .
We are bound to see what it means before he comes . &quot;
He opened the door and we stepped into the hall .
The droning sound <unk> louder upon our ears until it became one long , deep <unk> of distress .
It came from upstairs .
Holmes darted up and I followed him .
He pushed open a <unk> door and we both stood <unk> at the sight before us .
A woman , young and beautiful , was lying dead upon the bed .
Her calm , pale face , with dim , <unk> blue eyes , looked upward from amid a great tangle of golden hair .
At the foot of the bed , half sitting , half kneeling , his face buried in the clothes , was a young man , whose frame was <unk> by his <unk> .
So absorbed was he by his bitter grief that he never looked up until Holmes &apos;s hand was on his shoulder .
&quot; Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes ; I <unk> you are too late .
She is dead . &quot;
The man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance .
Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation , and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance , when there was a step upon the stairs , and there was the heavy , stern , questioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door .
&quot; So , gentlemen , &quot; said he , &quot; you have attained your end , and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion .
I would not <unk> in the presence of death , but I can assure you that if I were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity . &quot;
&quot; Excuse me , Dr. Armstrong , I think we are a little at <unk> , &quot; said my friend , with dignity .
&quot; If you could step downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this <unk> affair . &quot;
A minute later the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sittingroom below .
&quot; Well , sir ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; I wish you to understand , in the first place , that I am not employed by Lord MountJames , and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman .
When a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate , but having done so the matter ends so far as I am concerned ; and so long as there is nothing criminal , I am much more anxious to hush up private <unk> than to give them <unk> .
If , as I imagine , there is no breach of the law in this matter , you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my cooperation in keeping the facts out of the papers . &quot;
Dr. Armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung Holmes by the hand .
&quot; You are a good fellow , &quot; said he .
&quot; I had <unk> you .
I thank Heaven that my <unk> at leaving poor Staunton all alone in this <unk> caused me to turn my carriage back , and so to make your acquaintance .
Knowing as much as you do , the situation is very easily explained .
A year ago Godfrey Staunton <unk> in London for a time , and became <unk> attached to his landlady &apos;s daughter , whom he married .
She was as good as she was beautiful , and as intelligent as she was good .
No man need be ashamed of such a wife .
But Godfrey was the heir to this <unk> old nobleman , and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his <unk> .
I knew the lad well , and I loved him for his many excellent qualities .
I did all I could to help him to keep things straight .
We did our very best to keep the thing from everyone , for when once such a whisper gets about it is not long before everyone has heard it .
<unk> to this lonely cottage and his own discretion , Godfrey has up to now succeeded .
Their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant who has at present gone for assistance to Trumpington .
But at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous <unk> to his wife .
It was consumption of the most <unk> kind .
The poor boy was half <unk> with grief , and yet he had to go to London to play this match , for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret .
I tried to <unk> him up by a wire , and he sent me one in reply imploring me to do all I could .
This was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen .
I did not tell him how urgent the danger was , for I knew that he could do no good here , but I sent the truth to the girl &apos;s father , and he very <unk> communicated it to Godfrey .
The result was that he came straight away in a state <unk> on frenzy , and has remained in the same state , kneeling at the end of her bed , until this morning death put an end to her sufferings .
That is all , Mr. Holmes , and I am sure that I can <unk> upon your discretion and that of your friend . &quot;
Holmes grasped the doctor &apos;s hand .
&quot; Come , Watson , &quot; said he , and we passed from that house of grief into the pale sunlight of the winter day .
It was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning during the winter of &apos; <unk> that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder .
It was Holmes .
The candle in his hand shone upon his eager , stooping face and told me at a glance that something was amiss .
&quot; Come , Watson , come ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; The game is <unk> .
Not a word !
Into your clothes and come ! &quot;
<unk> minutes later we were both in a cab and <unk> through the silent <unk> on our way to Charing Cross Station .
The first faint winter &apos;s dawn was beginning to appear , and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us , blurred and <unk> in the <unk> London reek .
Holmes <unk> in silence into his heavy coat , and I was glad to do the same , for the air was most bitter and neither of us had broken our fast .
It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station , and taken our places in the <unk> train , that we were sufficiently thawed , he to speak and I to listen .
Holmes drew a note from his pocket and read it aloud : &quot; Abbey Grange , <unk> , Kent , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; My dear Mr. Holmes : &quot; I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case .
It is something quite in your line .
Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it , but I beg you not to lose an instant , as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there .
&quot; Yours faithfully , &quot; Stanley Hopkins . &quot;
&quot; Hopkins has called me in seven times , and on each occasion his <unk> has been entirely justified , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; I fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection , and I must admit , Watson , that you have some power of <unk> which <unk> for much which I <unk> in your narratives .
Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even <unk> series of <unk> .
You <unk> over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy in order to <unk> upon sensational details which may excite , but cannot possibly <unk> , the reader . &quot;
&quot; Why do you not write them yourself ? &quot;
I said , with some bitterness .
&quot; I will , my dear Watson , I will .
At present I am , as you know , fairly busy , but I propose to devote my <unk> years to the <unk> of a <unk> which shall <unk> the whole art of detection into one volume .
Our present research appears to be a case of murder . &quot;
&quot; You think this Sir Eustace is dead , then ? &quot;
&quot; I should say so .
Hopkins &apos;s writing shows considerable agitation , and he is not an <unk> man .
Yes , I gather there has been violence , and that the body is left for our inspection .
A mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me .
As to the release of the lady , it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy .
We are moving in high life , Watson ; <unk> paper , &apos; <unk> . &apos;
<unk> , coatofarms , picturesque address .
I think that friend Hopkins will live up to his reputation and that we shall have an interesting morning .
The crime was committed before twelve last night . &quot;
&quot; How can you possibly tell ? &quot;
&quot; By an inspection of the trains and by <unk> the time .
The local police had to be called in , they had to communicate with Scotland Yard , Hopkins had to go out , and he in turn had to send for me .
All that makes a fair night &apos;s work .
Well , here we are at Chislehurst Station , and we shall soon set our doubts at rest . &quot;
A drive of a couple of miles through narrow country <unk> brought us to a park gate , which was opened for us by an old lodgekeeper , whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster .
The avenue ran through a noble park , between lines of ancient <unk> , and ended in a low , widespread house , <unk> in front after the fashion of <unk> .
The central part was evidently of a great age and <unk> in ivy , but the large windows showed that modern <unk> had been carried out , and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new .
The <unk> figure and alert , eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway .
&quot; I &apos;m very glad you have come , Mr. Holmes .
And you too , Dr. Watson !
But , indeed , if I had my time over again I should not have troubled you , for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do .
You remember that <unk> gang of burglars ? &quot;
&quot; What , the three Randalls ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly ; the father and two sons .
It &apos;s their work .
I have not a doubt of it .
They did a job at Sydenham a fortnight ago , and were seen and described .
<unk> cool to do another so soon and so near , but it is they , beyond all doubt .
It &apos;s a hanging matter this time . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eustace is dead , then ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; his head was knocked in with his own poker . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eustace Brackenstall , the driver tells me . &quot;
&quot; <unk> of the richest men in Kent .
Lady Brackenstall is in the morningroom .
Poor lady , she has had a most dreadful experience .
She seemed half dead when I saw her first .
I think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts .
Then we will examine the diningroom together . &quot;
Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person .
Seldom have I seen so graceful a figure , so womanly a presence , and so beautiful a face .
She was a <unk> , <unk> , blueeyed , and would , no doubt , have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard .
Her sufferings were physical as well as mental , for over one eye rose a hideous , <unk> <unk> , which her maid , a tall , austere woman , was <unk> <unk> with <unk> and water .
The lady lay back exhausted upon a couch , but her quick , observant gaze as we entered the room , and the alert expression of her beautiful features , showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience .
She was <unk> in a loose dressinggown of blue and silver , but a black <unk> <unk> was hung upon the couch beside her .
&quot; I have told you all that happened , Mr. Hopkins , &quot; she said , wearily ; &quot; could you not repeat it for me ?
Well , if you think it necessary , I will tell these gentlemen what occurred .
Have they been in the diningroom yet ? &quot;
&quot; I thought they had better hear your ladyship &apos;s story first . &quot;
&quot; I shall be glad when you can arrange matters .
It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there . &quot;
She <unk> and buried her face in her hands .
As she did so the loose <unk> fell back from her <unk> .
Holmes uttered an exclamation .
&quot; You have other injuries , madam !
What is this ? &quot;
Two vivid red <unk> stood out on one of the white , round <unk> .
She hastily covered it .
&quot; It is nothing .
It has no connection with the hideous business of last night .
If you and your friend will sit down I will tell you all I can .
&quot; I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall .
I have been married about a year .
I suppose that it is no use my <unk> to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one .
I fear that all our neighbours would tell you that , even if I were to attempt to deny it .
Perhaps the fault may be partly mine .
I was brought up in the <unk> , less conventional atmosphere of South Australia , and this English life , with its <unk> and its <unk> , is not congenial to me .
But the main reason lies in the one fact which is notorious to everyone , and that is that Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard .
To be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant .
Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and highspirited woman to be tied to him for day and night ?
It is a <unk> , a crime , a villainy to hold that such a marriage is <unk> .
I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the <unk> will not let such <unk> endure . &quot;
For an instant she sat up , her cheeks flushed , and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow .
Then the strong , <unk> hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion , and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing .
At last she continued : &quot; I will tell you about last night .
You are aware , perhaps , that in this house all servants sleep in the modern wing .
This central block is made up of the <unk> , with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above .
My maid Theresa sleeps above my room .
There is no one else , and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing .
This must have been well known to the robbers , or they would not have acted as they did .
&quot; Sir Eustace retired about halfpast ten .
The servants had already gone to their quarters .
Only my maid was up , and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until I needed her services .
I sat until after eleven in this room , absorbed in a book .
Then I walked round to see that all was right before I went upstairs .
It was my custom to do this myself , for , as I have explained , Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted .
I went into the kitchen , the butler &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the drawingroom , and finally the diningroom .
As I approached the window , which is covered with thick curtains , I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open .
I flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a <unk> , elderly man who had just stepped into the room .
The window is a long French one , which really forms a door leading to the lawn .
I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand , and , by its light , behind the first man I saw two others , who were in the act of entering .
I stepped back , but the fellow was on me in an instant .
He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat .
I opened my mouth to scream , but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye , and felled me to the ground .
I must have been <unk> for a few minutes , for when I came to myself I found that they had torn down the bellrope and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the diningroom table .
I was so firmly bound that I could not move , and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from <unk> any sound .
It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room .
He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds , and he came prepared for such a scene as he found .
He was dressed in his shirt and trousers , with his favourite blackthorn <unk> in his hand .
He rushed at one of the burglars , but <unk> was the elderly <unk> , picked the poker out of the grate , and struck him a horrible blow as he passed .
He fell without a groan , and never moved again .
I fainted once more , but again it could only have been a very few minutes during which I was insensible .
When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard , and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there .
Each of them had a glass in his hand .
I have already told you , have I not , that one was elderly , with a beard , and the others young , hairless lads .
They might have been a father with his two sons .
They talked together in <unk> .
Then they came over and made sure that I was still <unk> bound .
Finally they withdrew , closing the window after them .
It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free .
When I did so my screams brought the maid to my assistance .
The other servants were soon alarmed , and we sent for the local police , who instantly communicated with London .
That is really all that I can tell you , gentlemen , and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again . &quot;
&quot; Any questions , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
asked Hopkins .
&quot; I will not <unk> any further <unk> upon Lady Brackenstall &apos;s patience and time , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Before I go into the diningroom I should like to hear your experience . &quot;
He looked at the maid .
&quot; I saw the men before ever they came into the house , &quot; said she .
&quot; As I sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder , but I thought nothing of it at the time .
It was more than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream , and down I ran , to find her , poor <unk> , just as she says , and him on the floor with his blood and brains over the room .
It was enough to drive a woman out of her wits , tied there , and her very dress spotted with him ; but she never wanted courage , did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide , and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange hasn &apos;t learned new ways .
You &apos;ve <unk> her long enough , you gentlemen , and now she is coming to her own room , just with her old Theresa , to get the rest that she badly needs . &quot;
With a <unk> <unk> the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room .
&quot; She has been with her all her life , &quot; said Hopkins .
&quot; <unk> her as a <unk> , and came with her to England when they first left Australia eighteen months ago .
Theresa Wright is her name , and the kind of maid you don &apos;t pick up <unk> .
This way , Mr. Holmes , if you please ! &quot;
The keen interest had passed out of Holmes &apos;s expressive face , and I knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed .
There still remained an arrest to be effected , but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them ?
An abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of <unk> would experience something of the annoyance which I read in my friend &apos;s eyes .
Yet the scene in the diningroom of the Abbey Grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest .
It was a very large and high chamber , with <unk> oak ceiling , oaken <unk> , and a fine <unk> of <unk> &apos;s heads and ancient weapons around the walls .
At the farther end from the door was the high French window of which we had heard .
Three <unk> windows on the righthand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine .
On the left was a large , deep fireplace , with a massive , <unk> oak mantelpiece .
Beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and <unk> at the bottom .
In and out through the open woodwork was <unk> a crimson cord , which was secured at each side to the <unk> below .
In releasing the lady the cord had been slipped off her , but the knots with which it had been secured still remained .
These details only struck our attention afterwards , for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the <unk> hearthrug in front of the fire .
It was the body of a tall , <unk> man , about <unk> years of age .
He lay upon his back , his face upturned , with his white teeth grinning through his short black beard .
His two clenched hands were raised above his head , and a heavy blackthorn stick lay across them .
His dark , handsome , aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred , which had set his dead face in a terribly <unk> expression .
He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out , for he wore a <unk> <unk> nightshirt , and his bare feet projected from his trousers .
His head was horribly injured , and the whole room bore witness to the savage <unk> of the blow which had struck him down .
Beside him lay the heavy poker , bent into a curve by the <unk> .
Holmes examined both it and the <unk> wreck which it had wrought .
&quot; He must be a powerful man , this elder Randall , &quot; he remarked .
&quot; Yes , &quot; said Hopkins .
&quot; I have some record of the fellow , and he is a rough customer . &quot;
&quot; You should have no difficulty in getting him . &quot;
&quot; Not the <unk> .
We have been on the lookout for him , and there was some idea that he had got away to America .
Now that we know the gang are here I don &apos;t see how they can escape .
We have the news at every <unk> already , and a reward will be offered before evening .
What beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing , knowing that the lady could describe them , and that we could not fail to recognise the description . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
One would have expected that they would have <unk> Lady Brackenstall as well . &quot;
&quot; They may not have realized , &quot; I suggested , &quot; that she had recovered from her faint . &quot;
&quot; That is likely enough .
If she seemed to be senseless they would not take her life .
What about this poor fellow , Hopkins ?
I seem to have heard some queer <unk> about him . &quot;
&quot; He was a <unk> man when he was <unk> , but a perfect fiend when he was drunk , or rather when he was half drunk , for he seldom really went the whole way .
The <unk> seemed to be in him at such times , and he was capable of anything .
From what I hear , in spite of all his wealth and his title , he very nearly came our way once or twice .
There was a scandal about his <unk> a dog with <unk> and <unk> it on <unk> ladyship &apos;s dog , to make the matter <unk> that was only hushed up with difficulty .
Then he threw a decanter at that maid , Theresa Wright ; there was trouble about that .
On the whole , and between ourselves , it will be a brighter house without him .
What are you looking at now ? &quot;
Holmes was down on his knees examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured .
Then he carefully <unk> the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down .
&quot; When this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly , &quot; he remarked .
&quot; No one could hear it .
The kitchen stands right at the back of the house . &quot;
&quot; How did the burglar know no one would hear it ?
How dared he pull at a bellrope in that <unk> fashion ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly , Mr. Holmes , exactly .
You put the very question which I have asked myself again and again .
There can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits .
He must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour , and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen .
Therefore he must have been in close league with one of the servants .
Surely that is evident .
But there are eight servants , and all of good character . &quot;
&quot; Other things being equal , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter .
And yet that would involve <unk> towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted .
Well , well , the point is a <unk> one , and when you have Randall you will probably find no difficulty in <unk> his accomplice .
The lady &apos;s story certainly seems to be <unk> , if it needed corroboration , by every detail which we see before us . &quot;
He walked to the French window and threw it open .
&quot; There are no signs here , but the ground is iron hard , and one would not expect them .
I see that these candles on the mantelpiece have been lighted . &quot;
&quot; Yes ; it was by their light and that of the lady &apos;s bedroom candle that the burglars saw their way about . &quot;
&quot; And what did they take ? &quot;
&quot; Well , they did not take <unk> halfadozen articles of plate off the sideboard .
Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not <unk> the house as they would otherwise have done . &quot;
&quot; No doubt that is true .
And yet they drank some wine , I understand . &quot;
&quot; To steady their own nerves . &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched , I suppose ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; and the bottle stands as they left it . &quot;
&quot; Let us look at it .
Halloa !
halloa !
what is this ? &quot;
The three glasses were <unk> together , all of them tinged with wine , and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing .
The bottle stood near them , <unk> full , and beside it lay a long , <unk> cork .
<unk> appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common <unk> which the murderers had enjoyed .
A change had come over Holmes &apos;s manner .
He had lost his listless expression , and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen , deepset eyes .
He raised the cork and examined it minutely .
&quot; How did they draw it ? &quot;
he asked .
Hopkins pointed to a <unk> drawer .
In it lay some table <unk> and a large <unk> .
&quot; Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used ? &quot;
&quot; No ; you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened . &quot;
&quot; Quite so .
As a matter of fact that screw was not used .
This bottle was opened by a <unk> , probably contained in a knife , and not more than an inch and a half long .
If you examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted .
It has never been transfixed .
This long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it with a single pull .
When you catch this fellow you will find that he has one of these <unk> knives in his possession . &quot;
&quot; Excellent ! &quot;
said Hopkins .
&quot; But these glasses do puzzle me , I confess .
Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking , did she not ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she was clear about that . &quot;
&quot; Then there is an end of it .
What more is to be said ?
And yet you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable , Hopkins .
What , you see nothing remarkable !
Well , well , let it pass .
Perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own it rather <unk> him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand .
Of course , it must be a mere chance about the glasses .
Well , good morning , Hopkins .
I don &apos;t see that I can be of any use to you , and you appear to have your case very clear .
You will let me know when Randall is arrested , and any further developments which may occur .
I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion .
Come , Watson , I fancy that we may employ ourselves more <unk> at home . &quot;
During our return journey I could see by Holmes &apos;s face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed .
Every now and then , by an effort , he would throw off the impression and talk as if the matter were clear , but then his doubts would settle down upon him again , and his <unk> brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great diningroom of the Abbey Grange in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted .
At last , by a sudden impulse , just as our train was <unk> out of a suburban station , he sprang on to the <unk> and pulled me out after him .
&quot; Excuse me , my dear fellow , &quot; said he , as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve ; &quot; I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere <unk> , but on my life , Watson , I simply can &apos;t leave that case in this condition .
Every instinct that I possess cries out against it .
It &apos;s <unk> &apos;s all <unk> &apos;ll swear that it &apos;s wrong .
And yet the lady &apos;s story was complete , the maid &apos;s corroboration was sufficient , the detail was fairly exact .
What have I to put against that ?
Three wineglasses , that is all .
But if I had not taken things for granted , if I had examined everything with care which I would have shown had we approached the case <unk> <unk> and had no <unk> story to warp my mind , would I not then have found something more definite to go upon ?
Of course I should .
Sit down on this <unk> , Watson , until a train for Chislehurst <unk> , and allow me to lay the evidence before you , imploring you in the first <unk> to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true .
The lady &apos;s charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment .
&quot; Surely there are details in her story which , if we looked at it in cold blood , would excite our suspicion .
These burglars made a considerable <unk> at Sydenham a fortnight ago .
Some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers , and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which <unk> robbers should play a part .
As a matter of fact , burglars who have done a good stroke of business are , as a rule , only too glad to enjoy the <unk> in peace and quiet without <unk> on another <unk> <unk> .
Again , it is unusual for burglars to <unk> at so early an hour ; it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming , since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream ; it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to <unk> one man ; it is unusual for them to be content with a <unk> plunder when there is much more within their reach ; and finally I should say that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty .
How do all these <unk> strike you , Watson ? &quot;
&quot; Their <unk> effect is certainly considerable , and yet each of them is quite possible in itself .
The most unusual thing of all , as it seems to me , is that the lady should be tied to the chair . &quot;
&quot; Well , I am not so clear about that , Watson ; for it is evident that they must either <unk> her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape .
But at any <unk> I have shown , have I not , that there is a certain <unk> of <unk> about the lady &apos;s story ?
And now on the top of this comes the incident of the wineglasses . &quot;
&quot; What about the wineglasses ? &quot;
&quot; Can you see them in your mind &apos;s eye ? &quot;
&quot; I see them clearly . &quot;
&quot; We are told that three men drank from them .
Does that strike you as likely ? &quot;
&quot; Why not ?
There was wine in each glass . &quot;
&quot; Exactly ; but there was beeswing only in one glass .
You must have noticed that fact .
What does that suggest to your mind ? &quot;
&quot; The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing . &quot;
&quot; Not at all .
The bottle was full of it , and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily <unk> with it .
There are two possible explanations , and only two .
One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was <unk> agitated , and so the third glass received the beeswing .
That does not appear probable .
No , no ; I am sure that I am right . &quot;
&quot; What , then , do you suppose ? &quot;
&quot; That only two glasses were used , and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass , so as to give the false impression that three people had been here .
In that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass , would it not ?
Yes , I am convinced that this is so .
But if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small <unk> , then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable , for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have <unk> lied to us , that not one word of their story is to be believed , that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal , and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them .
That is the mission which now lies before us , and here , Watson , is the Chislehurst train . &quot;
The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return , but Sherlock Holmes , finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to headquarters , took possession of the diningroom , locked the door upon the inside , and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious <unk> which formed the solid basis on which his brilliant <unk> of <unk> were <unk> .
<unk> in a corner like an interested student who observes the <unk> of his professor , I followed every step of that remarkable research .
The window , the curtains , the carpet , the chair , the <unk> in turn was minutely examined and duly <unk> .
The body of the unfortunate <unk> had been removed , but all else remained as we had seen it in the morning .
Then , to my astonishment , Holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece .
Far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire .
For a long time he gazed upward at it , and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall .
This brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope , but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention .
Finally he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , Watson , &quot; said he .
&quot; We have got our <unk> of the most remarkable in our collection .
But , dear me , how <unk> I have been , and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my lifetime !
Now , I think that with a few missing links my chain is almost complete . &quot;
&quot; You have got your men ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , Watson , man .
Only one , but a very formidable person .
<unk> as a <unk> the blow that bent that poker .
Six foot three in height , active as a <unk> , <unk> with his fingers ; finally , remarkably <unk> , for this whole ingenious story is of his <unk> .
Yes , Watson , we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual .
And yet in that bellrope he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt . &quot;
&quot; Where was the clue ? &quot;
&quot; Well , if you were to pull down a bellrope , Watson , where would you expect it to break ?
Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire .
Why should it break three inches from the top as this one has done ? &quot;
&quot; Because it is frayed there ? &quot;
&quot; Exactly .
This end , which we can examine , is frayed .
He was cunning enough to do that with his knife .
But the other end is not frayed .
You could not observe that from here , but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of <unk> whatever .
You can reconstruct what occurred .
The man needed the rope .
He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by <unk> the bell .
What did he do ?
He sprang up on the mantelpiece , could not quite reach it , put his knee on the <unk> will see the impression in the <unk> so got his knife to bear upon the cord .
I could not reach the place by at least three inches , from which I infer that he is at least three inches a <unk> man than I.
Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair !
What is it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Undoubtedly it is blood .
This alone puts the lady &apos;s story out of court .
If she were seated on the chair when the crime was done , how comes that mark ?
No , no ; she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband .
I &apos;ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this .
We have not yet met our Waterloo , Watson , but this is our <unk> , for it begins in defeat and ends in victory .
I should like now to have a few words with the nurse Theresa .
We must be <unk> for <unk> , if we are to get the information which we want . &quot;
She was an interesting person , this stern Australian nurse .
<unk> , suspicious , ungracious , it took some time before Holmes &apos;s pleasant manner and frank <unk> of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding <unk> .
She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer .
&quot; Yes , sir , it is true that he threw the decanter at me .
I heard him call my mistress a name , and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there .
Then it was that he threw it at me .
He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my <unk> bird alone .
He was for ever <unk> her , and she too proud to complain .
She will not even tell me all that he has done to her .
She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning , but I know very well that they come from a stab with a <unk> .
The sly <unk> forgive me that I should speak of him so , now that he is dead , but a fiend he was if ever one walked the earth .
He was all <unk> when first we met him , only eighteen months ago , and we both feel as if it were eighteen years .
She had only just arrived in London .
Yes , it was her first <unk> had never been from home before .
He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways .
If she made a mistake she has paid for it , if ever a woman did .
What month did we meet him ?
Well , I tell you it was just after we arrived .
We arrived in June , and it was July .
They were married in <unk> of last year .
Yes , she is down in the morningroom again , and I have no doubt she will see you , but you must not ask too much of her , for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand . &quot;
Lady Brackenstall was <unk> on the same couch , but looked brighter than before .
The maid had entered with us , and began once more to <unk> the <unk> upon her mistress &apos;s brow .
&quot; I hope , &quot; said the lady , &quot; that you have not come to <unk> me again ? &quot;
&quot; No , &quot; Holmes answered , in his gentlest voice , &quot; I will not cause you any unnecessary trouble , Lady Brackenstall , and my whole desire is to make things easy for you , for I am convinced that you are a <unk> woman .
If you will treat me as a friend and trust me you may find that I will justify your trust . &quot;
&quot; What do you want me to do ? &quot;
&quot; To tell me the truth . &quot;
&quot; Mr.
Holmes ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , Lady Brackenstall , it is no use .
You may have heard of any little reputation which I possess .
I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute <unk> . &quot;
<unk> and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes .
&quot; You are an <unk> fellow ! &quot;
cried Theresa .
&quot; Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie ? &quot;
Holmes rose from his chair .
&quot; Have you nothing to tell me ? &quot;
&quot; I have told you everything . &quot;
&quot; Think once more , Lady Brackenstall .
Would it not be better to be frank ? &quot;
For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face .
Then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask .
&quot; I have told you all I know . &quot;
Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders .
&quot; I am sorry , &quot; he said , and without another word we left the room and the house .
There was a pond in the park , and to this my friend led the way .
It was frozen over , but a single hole was left for the <unk> of a solitary <unk> .
Holmes gazed at it and then passed on to the lodge gate .
There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins and left it with the lodgekeeper .
&quot; It may be a hit or it may be a miss , but we are bound to do something for friend Hopkins , just to justify this second visit , &quot; said he .
&quot; I will not quite take him into my confidence yet .
I think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the AdelaideSouthampton line , which stands at the end of Pall Mall , if I remember right .
There is a second line of <unk> which connect South Australia with England , but we will draw the larger cover first . &quot;
Holmes &apos;s card sent in to the manager <unk> instant attention , and he was not long in <unk> all the information which he needed .
In June of &apos; 95 only one of their line had reached a home <unk> .
It was the Rock of Gibraltar , their largest and best boat .
A reference to the passenger list showed that Miss Fraser of Adelaide , with her maid , had made the voyage in her .
The boat was now on her way to Australia , somewhere to the south of the <unk> <unk> .
Her officers were the same as in &apos; 95 , with one exception .
The first officer , Mr. Jack Croker , had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship , the <unk> Rock , <unk> in two days &apos; time from <unk> .
He lived at Sydenham , but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions , if we cared to wait for him .
No ; Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him , but would be glad to know more about his record and character .
His record was magnificent .
There was not an officer in the <unk> to touch him .
As to his character , he was reliable on duty , but a wild , desperate fellow off the deck of his ship , hotheaded , excitable , but <unk> , honest , and <unk> .
That was the pith of the information with which Holmes left the office of the AdelaideSouthampton company .
<unk> he drove to Scotland Yard , but instead of entering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down , lost in profound thought .
Finally he drove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office , sent off a message , and then , at last , we made for Baker Street once more .
&quot; No , I couldn &apos;t do it , Watson , &quot; said he , as we <unk> our room .
&quot; Once that warrant was made out nothing on earth would save him .
Once or twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime .
I have learned caution now , and I had rather play tricks with the law of England than with my own conscience .
Let us know a little more before we act . &quot;
Before evening we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins .
Things were not going very well with him .
&quot; I believe that you are a wizard , Mr. Holmes .
I really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human .
Now , how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond ? &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; But you told me to examine it . &quot;
&quot; You got it , then ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I got it . &quot;
&quot; I am very glad if I have helped you . &quot;
&quot; But you haven &apos;t helped me .
You have made the affair far more difficult .
What sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond ? &quot;
&quot; It was certainly rather eccentric <unk> .
I was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it , who merely took it for a blind as it were , then they would naturally be anxious to get <unk> of it . &quot;
&quot; But why should such an idea cross your mind ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I thought it was possible .
When they came out through the French window there was the pond , with one tempting little hole in the ice , right in front of their <unk> .
Could there be a better hidingplace ? &quot;
&quot; Ah , a <unk> is better ! &quot;
cried Stanley Hopkins .
&quot; Yes , yes , I see it all now !
It was early , there were folk upon the roads , they were afraid of being seen with the silver , so they sank it in the pond , <unk> to return for it when the coast was clear .
Excellent , Mr. <unk> is better than your idea of a blind . &quot;
&quot; Quite so ; you have got an admirable theory .
I have no doubt that my own <unk> were quite wild , but you must admit that they have ended in <unk> the silver . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , yes .
It was all your doing .
But I have had a bad setback . &quot;
&quot; A setback ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Mr. Holmes .
The Randall gang were arrested in New York this morning . &quot;
&quot; Dear me , Hopkins !
That is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in Kent last night . &quot;
&quot; It is fatal , Mr. Holmes , absolutely fatal .
Still , there are other <unk> of three besides the Randalls , or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard . &quot;
&quot; Quite so ; it is perfectly possible .
What , are you off ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Mr. Holmes ; there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom of the business .
I suppose you have no hint to give me ? &quot;
&quot; I have given you one . &quot;
&quot; Which ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I suggested a blind . &quot;
&quot; But why , Mr. Holmes , why ? &quot;
&quot; Ah , that &apos;s the question , of course .
But I commend the idea to your mind .
You might possibly find that there was something in it .
You won &apos;t stop for dinner ?
Well , goodbye , and let us know how you get on . &quot;
<unk> was over and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the matter again .
He had lit his pipe and held his <unk> feet to the <unk> blaze of the fire .
Suddenly he looked at his watch .
&quot; I expect developments , Watson . &quot;
&quot; When ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> a few minutes .
I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins just now ? &quot;
&quot; I trust your judgment . &quot;
&quot; A very <unk> reply , Watson .
You must look at it this way : what I know is unofficial ; what he knows is official .
I have the right to private judgment , but he has none .
He must disclose all , or he is a <unk> to his service .
In a <unk> case I would not put him in so painful a position , and so I reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter . &quot;
&quot; But when will that be ? &quot;
&quot; The time has come .
You will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama . &quot;
There was a sound upon the stairs , and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it .
He was a very tall young man , <unk> , blueeyed , with a skin which had been burned by <unk> <unk> , and a springy step which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong .
He closed the door behind him , and then he stood with clenched hands and <unk> breast , choking down some overmastering emotion .
&quot; Sit down , Captain Croker .
You got my telegram ? &quot;
Our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes .
&quot; I got your telegram , and I came at the hour you said .
I heard that you had been down to the office .
There was no getting away from you .
Let &apos;s hear the worst .
What are you going to do with me ?
Arrest me ?
<unk> out , man !
You can &apos;t sit there and play with me like a cat with a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Give him a cigar , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; <unk> on that , Captain Croker , and don &apos;t let your nerves run away with you .
I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal , you may be sure of that .
<unk> frank with me , and we may do some good .
<unk> tricks with me , and I &apos;ll <unk> you . &quot;
&quot; What do you wish me to do ? &quot;
&quot; To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last <unk> true account , mind you , with nothing added and nothing taken off .
I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight I &apos;ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands for ever . &quot;
The sailor thought for a little .
Then he struck his leg with his great , sunburned hand .
&quot; I &apos;ll chance it , &quot; he cried .
&quot; I believe you are a man of your word , and a white man , and I &apos;ll tell you the whole story .
But one thing I will say first .
So far as I am concerned I regret nothing and I fear nothing , and I would do it all again and be proud of the job .
<unk> the beast , if he had as many lives as a cat he would owe them all to me !
But it &apos;s the lady , <unk> <unk> never will I call her by that <unk> name .
When I think of getting her into trouble , I who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face , it &apos;s that that turns my soul into water .
And yetand <unk> less could I do ?
I &apos;ll tell you my story , gentlemen , and then I &apos;ll ask you as man to man what less could I do .
&quot; I must go back a bit .
You seem to know everything , so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger and I was first officer of the Rock of Gibraltar .
From the first day I met her she was the only woman to me .
Every day of that voyage I loved her more , and many a time since have I <unk> down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had <unk> it .
She was never engaged to me .
She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man .
I have no complaint to make .
It was all love on my side , and all good <unk> and <unk> on hers .
When we parted she was a free woman , but I could never again be a free man .
&quot; Next time I came back from sea I heard of her marriage .
Well , why <unk> &apos;t she marry whom she liked ?
<unk> and <unk> could carry them better than she ?
She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty .
I didn &apos;t grieve over her marriage .
I was not such a selfish hound as that .
I just rejoiced that good luck had come her way , and that she had not thrown herself away on a <unk> sailor .
That &apos;s how I loved Mary Fraser .
&quot; Well , I never thought to see her again ; but last voyage I was <unk> , and the new boat was not yet <unk> , so I had to wait for a couple of months with my people at Sydenham .
One day out in a country lane I met Theresa Wright , her old maid .
She told me about her , about him , about everything .
I tell you , gentlemen , it nearly drove me mad .
This drunken hound , that he should dare to raise his hand to her whose boots he was not worthy to <unk> !
I met Theresa again .
Then I met Mary <unk> met her again .
Then she would meet me no more .
But the other day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week , and I determined that I would see her once before I left .
Theresa was always my friend , for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as much as I did .
From her I learned the ways of the house .
Mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs .
I crept round there last night and scratched at the window .
At first she would not open to me , but in her heart I know that now she loves me , and she could not leave me in the frosty night .
She whispered to me to come round to the big front window , and I found it open before me so as to let me into the diningroom .
Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood <unk> , and again I cursed this brute who <unk> the woman that I loved .
Well , gentlemen , I was standing with her just inside the window , in all <unk> , as Heaven is my judge , when he rushed like a madman into the room , called her the <unk> name that a man could use to a woman , and <unk> her across the face with the stick he had in his hand .
I had sprung for the poker , and it was a fair fight between us .
See here on my arm where his first blow fell .
Then it was my turn , and I went through him as if he had been a <unk> <unk> .
Do you think I was sorry ?
Not I !
It was his life or mine , but far more than that it was his life or hers , for how could I leave her in the power of this madman ?
That was how I killed him .
Was I wrong ?
Well , then , what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my position ?
&quot; She had screamed when he struck her , and that brought old Theresa down from the room above .
There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard , and I opened it and poured a little between Mary &apos;s lips , for she was half dead with the shock .
Then I took a drop myself .
Theresa was as cool as ice , and it was her plot as much as mine .
We must make it appear that burglars had done the thing .
Theresa kept on <unk> our story to her mistress , while I <unk> up and cut the rope of the bell .
Then I lashed her in her chair , and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural , else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it .
Then I gathered up a few <unk> and <unk> of silver , to carry out the idea of a robbery , and there I left them with orders to give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour &apos;s start .
I dropped the silver into the pond and made off for Sydenham , feeling that for once in my life I had done a real good night &apos;s work .
And that &apos;s the truth and the whole truth , Mr. Holmes , if it <unk> me my neck . &quot;
Holmes smoked for some time in silence .
Then he crossed the room and shook our visitor by the hand .
&quot; That &apos;s what I think , &quot; said he .
&quot; I know that every word is true , for you have hardly said a word which I did not know .
No one but an <unk> or a sailor could have got up to that bellrope from the bracket , and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair .
Only once had this lady been brought into contact with <unk> , and that was on her voyage , and it was someone of her own class of life , since she was trying hard to shield him and so showing that she loved him .
You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once I had started upon the right trail . &quot;
&quot; I thought the police never could have seen through our <unk> . &quot;
&quot; And the police haven &apos;t ; nor will they , to the best of my belief .
Now , look here , Captain Croker , this is a very serious matter , though I am <unk> to admit that you acted under the most extreme <unk> to which any man could be subjected .
I am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate .
However , that is for a British jury to decide .
Meanwhile I have so much sympathy for you that if you choose to disappear in the next <unk> hours I will promise you that no one will <unk> you . &quot;
&quot; And then it will all come out ? &quot;
&quot; Certainly it will come out . &quot;
The sailor flushed with anger .
&quot; What sort of <unk> is that to make a man ?
I know enough of law to understand that Mary would be had as accomplice .
Do you think I would leave her alone to face the music while I <unk> away ?
No , sir ; let them do their worst upon me , but for Heaven &apos;s sake , Mr. Holmes , find some way of keeping my poor Mary out of the <unk> . &quot;
Holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor .
&quot; I was only <unk> you , and you ring true every time .
Well , it is a great responsibility that I take upon myself , but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint , and if he can &apos;t avail himself of it I can do no more .
See here , Captain Croker , we &apos;ll do this in due form of law .
You are the prisoner .
Watson , you are a British jury , and I never met a man who was more <unk> <unk> to represent one .
I am the judge .
Now , gentleman of the jury , you have heard the evidence .
Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty ? &quot;
&quot; Not guilty , my lord , &quot; said I.
&quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You are <unk> , Captain Croker .
So long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me .
Come back to this lady in a year , and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night . &quot;
I had intended &quot; The Adventure of the Abbey Grange &quot; to be the last of those <unk> of my friend , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , which I should ever communicate to the public .
This resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material , since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which I have never alluded , nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man .
The real reason lay in the <unk> which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences .
So long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him ; but since he has definitely retired from London and <unk> himself to study and <unk> on the Sussex <unk> , notoriety has become <unk> to him , and he has <unk> <unk> that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed .
It was only upon my <unk> to him that I had given a promise that &quot; The Adventure of the <unk> <unk> &quot; should be <unk> when the times were <unk> , and pointing out to him that it is only <unk> that this long series of <unk> should <unk> in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle , that I at last succeeded in <unk> his consent that a <unk> account of the incident should at last be laid before the public .
If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence .
It was , then , in a year , and even in a <unk> , that shall be <unk> , that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street .
The one , austere , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger , twice Premier of Britain .
The other , dark , clearcut , and <unk> , hardly yet of middle age , and <unk> with every beauty of body and of mind , was the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope , Secretary for European <unk> , and the most rising statesman in the country .
They sat side by side upon our <unk> settee , and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them .
The Premier &apos;s thin , <unk> hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella , and his gaunt , ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me .
The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watchchain .
&quot; When I discovered my loss , Mr. Holmes , which was at eight o &apos;clock this morning , I at once informed the Prime Minister .
It was at his suggestion that we have both come to you . &quot;
&quot; Have you informed the police ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , &quot; said the Prime Minister , with the quick , <unk> manner for which he was famous .
&quot; We have not done so , nor is it possible that we should do so .
To inform the police must , in the long run , mean to inform the public .
This is what we particularly desire to avoid . &quot;
&quot; And why , sir ? &quot;
&quot; Because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very <unk> might almost say <unk> to European <unk> of the utmost moment .
It is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue .
Unless its <unk> can be <unk> with the utmost secrecy , then it may as well not be recovered at all , for all that is <unk> at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known . &quot;
&quot; I understand .
Now , Mr. Trelawney Hope , I should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared . &quot;
&quot; That can be done in a very few words , Mr. Holmes .
The <unk> it was a letter from a foreign <unk> received six days ago .
It was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe , but I have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace , and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatchbox .
It was there last night .
Of that I am certain .
I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner , and saw the document inside .
This morning it was gone .
The despatchbox had stood beside the glass upon my <unk> all night .
I am a light sleeper , and so is my wife .
We are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night .
And yet I repeat that the paper is gone . &quot;
&quot; What time did you dine ? &quot;
&quot; Halfpast seven . &quot;
&quot; How long was it before you went to bed ? &quot;
&quot; My wife had gone to the theatre .
I waited up for her .
It was halfpast eleven before we went to our room . &quot;
&quot; Then for four hours the despatchbox had lain unguarded ? &quot;
&quot; No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning , and my valet , or my wife &apos;s maid , during the rest of the day .
They are both <unk> servants who have been with us for some time .
Besides , neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatchbox . &quot;
&quot; Who did know of the existence of that letter ? &quot;
&quot; No one in the house . &quot;
&quot; Surely your wife knew ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this morning . &quot;
The Premier nodded approvingly .
&quot; I have long known , sir , how high is your sense of public duty , &quot; said he .
&quot; I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise <unk> to the most intimate domestic <unk> . &quot;
The European Secretary bowed .
&quot; You do me no more than justice , sir .
Until this morning I have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter . &quot;
&quot; Could she have guessed ? &quot;
&quot; No , Mr. Holmes , she could not have <unk> could anyone have guessed . &quot;
&quot; Have you lost any documents before ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir . &quot;
&quot; Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter ? &quot;
&quot; Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday ; but the pledge of secrecy which <unk> every Cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister .
Good heavens , to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it ! &quot;
His handsome face was <unk> with a spasm of despair , and his hands tore at his hair .
For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man , impulsive , ardent , keenly sensitive .
The next the aristocratic mask was replaced , and the gentle voice had returned .
&quot; Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two , or possibly three , departmental officials who know of the letter .
No one else in England , Mr. Holmes , I assure you . &quot;
&quot; But abroad ? &quot;
&quot; I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it .
I am well convinced that his <unk> the usual official <unk> have not been employed . &quot;
Holmes considered for some little time .
&quot; Now , sir , I must ask you more particularly what this document is , and why its disappearance should have such <unk> consequences ? &quot;
The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier &apos;s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown .
&quot; Mr. Holmes , the envelope is a long , thin one of pale blue colour .
There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching <unk> .
It is addressed in large , bold <unk> to &quot; &quot; I fear , sir , &quot; said Holmes , &quot; that , interesting and indeed essential as these details are , my inquiries must go more to the <unk> of things .
What was the letter ? &quot;
&quot; That is a State secret of the utmost importance , and I fear that I cannot tell you , nor do I see that it is necessary .
If by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as I describe with its <unk> , you will have <unk> well of your country , and earned any reward which it lies in our power to <unk> . &quot;
Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile .
&quot; You are two of the most busy men in the country , &quot; said he , &quot; and in my own small way I have also a good many <unk> upon me .
I regret exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter , and any <unk> of this interview would be a waste of time . &quot;
The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick , fierce gleam of his deepset eyes before which a Cabinet has <unk> .
&quot; I am not accustomed , sir &quot; he began , but mastered his anger and resumed his seat .
For a minute or more we all sat in silence .
Then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders .
&quot; We must accept your terms , Mr. Holmes .
No doubt you are right , and it is <unk> for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence . &quot;
&quot; I agree with you , sir , &quot; said the younger statesman .
&quot; Then I will tell you , <unk> entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague , Dr. Watson .
I may appeal to your <unk> also , for I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out . &quot;
&quot; You may safely trust us . &quot;
&quot; The letter , then , is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent <unk> developments of this country .
It has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely .
Inquiries have shown that his <unk> know nothing of the matter .
At the same time it is <unk> in so unfortunate a manner , and certain <unk> in it are of so <unk> a character , that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country .
There would be such a <unk> , sir , that I do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war . &quot;
Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier .
&quot; Exactly .
It was he .
And it is this <unk> letter which may well mean the <unk> of a thousand <unk> and the lives of a hundred thousand <unk> has become lost in this <unk> fashion . &quot;
&quot; Have you informed the sender ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , a <unk> telegram has been <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps he <unk> the publication of the letter . &quot;
&quot; No , sir , we have strong reason to believe that he already <unk> that he has acted in an indiscreet and hotheaded manner .
It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out . &quot;
&quot; If this is so , whose interest is it that the letter should come out ?
Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it ? &quot;
&quot; There , Mr. Holmes , you take me into <unk> of high international politics .
But if you consider the European situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive .
The whole of Europe is an armed <unk> .
There is a double league which makes a fair balance of <unk> power .
Great Britain <unk> the <unk> .
If Britain were driven into war with one confederacy , it would assure the <unk> of the other confederacy , whether they joined in the war or not .
Do you follow ? &quot;
&quot; Very clearly .
It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter , so as to make a breach between his country and ours ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy ? &quot;
&quot; To any of the great <unk> of Europe .
It is probably <unk> on its way <unk> at the present instant as fast as steam can take it . &quot;
Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his <unk> and groaned aloud .
The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder .
&quot; It is your misfortune , my dear fellow .
No one can blame you .
There is no precaution which you have <unk> .
Now , Mr. Holmes , you are in full possession of the facts .
What course do you recommend ? &quot;
Holmes shook his head <unk> .
&quot; You think , sir , that unless this document is recovered there will be war ? &quot;
&quot; I think it is very probable . &quot;
&quot; Then , sir , prepare for war . &quot;
&quot; That is a hard saying , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; <unk> the facts , sir .
It is inconceivable that it was taken after eleventhirty at night , since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out .
It was taken , then , yesterday evening between seventhirty and eleventhirty , probably near the earlier hour , since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible .
Now , sir , if a document of this importance were taken at that hour , where can it be now ?
No one has any reason to <unk> it .
It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it .
What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it ?
It is beyond our reach . &quot;
The Prime Minister rose from the settee .
&quot; What you say is perfectly logical , Mr. Holmes .
I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands . &quot;
&quot; Let us presume , for argument &apos;s sake , that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet &quot; &quot; They are both old and tried servants . &quot;
&quot; I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor , that there is no entrance from without , and that from within no one could go up <unk> .
It must , then , be <unk> in the house who has taken it .
To whom would the thief take it ?
To one of several international spies and secret agents , whose names are <unk> familiar to me .
There are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession .
I will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post .
If one is <unk> if he has disappeared since last <unk> will have some indication as to where the document has gone . &quot;
&quot; Why should he be missing ? &quot;
asked the European Secretary .
&quot; He would take the letter to an Embassy in London , as likely as not . &quot;
&quot; I fancy not .
These agents work independently , and their relations with the <unk> are often strained . &quot;
The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence .
&quot; I believe you are right , Mr. Holmes .
He would take so valuable a prize to headquarters with his own hands .
I think that your course of action is an excellent one .
Meanwhile , Hope , we cannot <unk> all our other duties on account of this one misfortune .
Should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you , and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries . &quot;
The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room .
When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in silence , and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought .
I had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in London the night before , when my friend gave an exclamation , sprang to his feet , and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece .
&quot; Yes , &quot; said he , &quot; there is no better way of approaching it .
The situation is desperate , but not hopeless .
Even now , if we could be sure which of them has taken it , it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands .
After all , it is a question of money with these fellows , and I have the British <unk> behind me .
If it &apos;s on the market I &apos;ll buy <unk> it means another penny on the <unk> .
It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what <unk> come from this side before he tries his luck on the other .
There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game ; there are <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Eduardo Lucas .
I will see each of them . &quot;
I glanced at my morning paper .
&quot; Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; You will not see him . &quot;
&quot; Why not ? &quot;
&quot; He was murdered in his house last night . &quot;
My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of <unk> that I realized how completely I had astonished him .
He stared in amazement , and then snatched the paper from my hands .
This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair : Murder in Westminster A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16 , Godolphin Street , one of the oldfashioned and secluded <unk> of <unk> houses which lie between the river and the Abbey , almost in the shadow of the great <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr. Eduardo Lucas , well known in society <unk> both on account of his charming personality and because he has the <unk> reputation of being one of the best amateur <unk> in the country .
Mr. Lucas is an <unk> man , <unk> years of age , and his establishment consists of Mrs. <unk> , an elderly housekeeper , and of Mitton , his valet .
The former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house .
The valet was out for the evening , visiting a friend at Hammersmith .
From ten o &apos;clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to himself .
What occurred during that time has not yet <unk> , but at a quarter to twelve <unk> <unk> , passing along Godolphin Street , observed that the door of No .
16 was ajar .
He knocked , but received no answer .
<unk> a light in the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked , but without reply .
He then pushed open the door and entered .
The room was in a state of wild <unk> , the furniture being all swept to one side , and one chair lying on its back in the centre .
Beside this chair , and still <unk> one of its legs , lay the unfortunate tenant of the house .
He had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly .
The knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger , <unk> down from a trophy of <unk> arms which adorned one of the walls .
<unk> does not appear to have been the motive of the crime , for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room .
Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a widespread circle of friends .
&quot; Well , Watson , what do you make of this ? &quot;
asked Holmes , after a long pause .
&quot; It is an amazing coincidence . &quot;
&quot; A coincidence !
Here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama , and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted .
The <unk> are enormous against its being coincidence .
No figures could express them .
No , my dear Watson , the two events are <unk> be connected .
It is for us to find the connection . &quot;
&quot; But now the official police must know all . &quot;
&quot; Not at all .
They know all they see at Godolphin Street .
They <unk> shall <unk> of Whitehall Terrace .
Only we know of both events , and can trace the relation between them .
There is one obvious point which would , in any case , have turned my suspicions against Lucas .
Godolphin Street , Westminster , is only a few minutes &apos; walk from Whitehall Terrace .
The other secret agents whom I have named live in the extreme <unk> .
It was easier , therefore , for Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the European Secretary &apos;s <unk> small thing , and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential .
Halloa !
what have we here ? &quot;
Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady &apos;s card upon her <unk> .
Holmes glanced at it , raised his eyebrows , and handed it over to me .
&quot; Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up , &quot; said he .
A moment later our modest apartment , already so distinguished that morning , was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in London .
I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the Duke of <unk> , but no description of it , and no <unk> of <unk> photographs , had prepared me for the <unk> , delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that <unk> head .
And yet as we saw it that autumn morning , it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer .
The cheek was lovely , but it was <unk> with emotion ; the eyes were bright , but it was the <unk> of fever ; the sensitive mouth was <unk> and drawn in an effort after selfcommand .
<unk> <unk> what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door .
&quot; Has my husband been here , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , madam , he has been here . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Holmes , I implore you not to tell him that I came here . &quot;
Holmes bowed coldly , and <unk> the lady to a chair .
&quot; Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position .
I beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire ; but I fear that I cannot make any <unk> promise . &quot;
She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window .
It was a queenly <unk> , graceful , and intensely womanly .
&quot; Mr. Holmes , &quot; she said , and her <unk> hands clasped and <unk> as she spoke &quot; I will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return .
There is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one .
That one is politics .
On this his lips are sealed .
He tells me nothing .
Now , I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night .
I know that a paper has disappeared .
But because the matter is political my husband <unk> to take me into his complete confidence .
Now it is <unk> , I <unk> I should thoroughly understand it .
You are the only other person , save only these politicians , who knows the true facts .
I beg you , then , Mr. Holmes , to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to .
Tell me all , Mr. Holmes .
Let no regard for your client &apos;s interests keep you silent , for I assure you that his interests , if he would only see it , would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence .
What was this paper which was stolen ? &quot;
&quot; Madam , what you ask me is really impossible . &quot;
She groaned and sank her face in her hands .
&quot; You must see that this is so , madam .
If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter , is it for me , who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy , to tell what he has <unk> ?
It is not fair to ask it .
It is him whom you must ask . &quot;
&quot; I have asked him .
I come to you as a last <unk> .
But without your telling me anything definite , Mr. Holmes , you may do a great service if you would <unk> me on one point . &quot;
&quot; What is it , madam ? &quot;
&quot; Is my husband &apos;s political career likely to suffer through this incident ? &quot;
&quot; Well , madam , unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect . &quot;
&quot; Ah ! &quot;
She drew in her breath <unk> as one whose doubts are <unk> .
&quot; One more question , Mr. Holmes .
From an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document . &quot;
&quot; If he said so , I certainly cannot deny it . &quot;
&quot; Of what nature are they ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , madam , there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer . &quot;
&quot; Then I will take up no more of your time .
I cannot blame you , Mr. Holmes , for having refused to speak more freely , and you on your side will not , I am sure , think the worse of me because I desire , even against his will , to share my husband &apos;s <unk> .
Once more I beg that you will say nothing of my visit . &quot;
She looked back at us from the door , and I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face , the <unk> eyes , and the drawn mouth .
Then she was gone .
&quot; Now , Watson , the fair <unk> is your <unk> , &quot; said Holmes , with a smile , when the dwindling <unk> of <unk> had ended in the slam of the front door .
&quot; What was the fair lady &apos;s game ?
What did she really want ? &quot;
&quot; Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural . &quot;
&quot; Hum !
Think of her appearance , <unk> manner , her suppressed excitement , her <unk> , her <unk> in asking questions .
Remember that she comes of a <unk> who do not <unk> show emotion . &quot;
&quot; She was certainly much moved . &quot;
&quot; Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all .
What did she mean by that ?
And you must have observed , Watson , how she <unk> to have the light at her back .
She did not wish us to read her expression . &quot;
&quot; Yes ; she chose the one chair in the room . &quot;
&quot; And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable .
You remember the woman at <unk> whom I suspected for the same reason .
No powder on her <unk> proved to be the correct solution .
How can you build on such a <unk> ?
Their most trivial action may mean volumes , or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a <unk> or a <unk> .
Good morning , Watson . &quot;
&quot; You are off ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; I will <unk> away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends of the regular establishment .
With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of our problem , though I must admit that I have not an <unk> as to what form it may take .
It is a capital mistake to <unk> in advance of the facts .
Do you stay on guard , my good Watson , and receive any fresh visitors .
I &apos;ll join you at lunch if I am able . &quot;
All that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his friends would call <unk> , and others morose .
He ran out and ran in , smoked incessantly , played <unk> on his violin , sank into <unk> , <unk> <unk> at irregular hours , and hardly answered the <unk> questions which I put to him .
It was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest .
He would say nothing of the case , and it was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest , and the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton , the valet of the deceased .
The <unk> &apos;s jury brought in the obvious &quot; <unk> Murder , &quot; but the parties remained as unknown as ever .
No motive was suggested .
The room was full of articles of value , but none had been taken .
The dead man &apos;s papers had not been tampered with .
They were carefully examined , and showed that he was a keen student of international politics , an <unk> gossip , a remarkable <unk> , and an <unk> <unk> .
He had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several <unk> .
But nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers .
As to his relations with women , they appeared to have been promiscuous but <unk> .
He had many <unk> among them , but few friends , and no one whom he loved .
His habits were regular , his conduct <unk> .
His death was an absolute mystery , and likely to remain so .
As to the arrest of John Mitton , the valet , it was a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction .
But no case could be sustained against him .
He had visited friends in Hammersmith that night .
The alibi was complete .
It is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to Westminster before the time when the crime was discovered , but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the <unk> of the night .
He had actually arrived at twelve o &apos;clock , and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy .
He had always been on good terms with his master .
Several of the dead man &apos;s <unk> a small case of <unk> been found in the valet &apos;s <unk> , but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased , and the housekeeper was able to <unk> the story .
Mitton had been in Lucas &apos;s employment for three years .
It was <unk> that Lucas did not take Mitton on the <unk> with him .
Sometimes he visited Paris for three months on end , but Mitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street house .
As to the housekeeper , she had heard nothing on the night of the crime .
If her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him .
So for three mornings the mystery remained , so far as I could follow it in the papers .
If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel , but , as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case , I knew that he was in close touch with every development .
Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from Paris which seemed to solve the whole question .
A discovery has just been made by the <unk> police said the Daily Telegraph which <unk> the veil which hung round the tragic fate of Mr. Eduardo Lucas , who met his death by violence last Monday night at Godolphin Street , Westminster .
Our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room , and that some suspicion attached to his valet , but that the case broke down on an alibi .
Yesterday a lady , who has been known as Mme.
Henri Fournaye , <unk> a small villa in the <unk> <unk> , was reported to the <unk> by her servants as being insane .
An examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and <unk> form .
On inquiry the police have discovered that Mme.
Henri Fournaye only returned from a journey to London on Tuesday last , and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at Westminster .
A comparison of photographs has proved <unk> that <unk> Henri Fournaye and Eduardo Lucas were really one and the same person , and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in London and Paris .
Mme.
Fournaye , who is of <unk> origin , is of an extremely excitable nature , and has <unk> in the past from <unk> of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy .
It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in London .
Her movements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced , but it is <unk> that a woman answering to her description <unk> much attention at Charing Cross Station on Tuesday morning by the <unk> of her appearance and the violence of her <unk> .
It is probable , therefore , that the crime was either committed when insane , or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind .
At present she is unable to give any <unk> account of the past , and the doctors hold out no hopes of the <unk> of her reason .
There is evidence that a woman , who might have been Mme.
Fournaye , was seen for some hours on Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street .
&quot; What do you think of that , Holmes ? &quot;
I had read the account aloud to him , while he finished his breakfast .
&quot; My dear Watson , &quot; said he , as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room , &quot; you are most longsuffering , but if I have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell .
Even now this report from Paris does not help us much . &quot;
&quot; Surely it is final as <unk> the man &apos;s death . &quot;
&quot; The man &apos;s death is a mere <unk> trivial <unk> comparison with our real task , which is to trace this document and save a European catastrophe .
Only one important thing has happened in the last three days , and that is that nothing has happened .
I get reports almost <unk> from the Government , and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble .
Now , if this letter were <unk> , it can &apos;t be <unk> if it isn &apos;t loose , where can it be ?
Who has it ?
Why is it held back ?
That &apos;s the question that beats in my brain like a <unk> .
Was it , indeed , a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared ?
Did the letter ever reach him ?
If so , why is it not among his papers ?
Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her ?
If so , is it in her house in Paris ?
How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused ?
It is a case , my dear Watson , where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are .
Every man &apos;s hand is against us , and yet the interests at stake are <unk> .
Should I bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the <unk> glory of my career .
Ah , here is my latest from the front ! &quot;
He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in .
&quot; Halloa !
Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest .
Put on your hat , Watson , and we will stroll down together to Westminster . &quot;
It was my first visit to the scene of the <unk> high , <unk> , <unk> house , <unk> , <unk> , and solid , like the century which gave it <unk> .
Lestrade &apos;s bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window , and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in .
The room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed , but no trace of it now remained , save an ugly , irregular stain upon the carpet .
This carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room , surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful , oldfashioned <unk> in square blocks highly polished .
Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons , one of which had been used on that tragic night .
In the window was a <unk> writingdesk , and every detail of the apartment , the pictures , the <unk> , and the <unk> , all pointed to a taste which was <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
&quot; <unk> the Paris news ? &quot;
asked Lestrade .
Holmes nodded .
&quot; Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time .
No doubt it &apos;s just as they say .
She knocked at the <unk> visit , I guess , for he kept his life in <unk> <unk> .
He let her <unk> &apos;t keep her in the street .
She told him how she had traced him , <unk> him , one thing led to another , and then with that dagger so <unk> the end soon came .
It wasn &apos;t all done in an instant , though , for these chairs were all swept over yonder , and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it .
We &apos;ve got it all clear as if we had seen it . &quot;
Holmes raised his eyebrows .
&quot; And yet you have sent for me ? &quot;
&quot; Ah , yes , that &apos;s another <unk> mere trifle , but the sort of thing you take an interest <unk> , you know , and what you might call <unk> .
It has nothing to do with the main <unk> &apos;t have , on the face of it . &quot;
&quot; What is it , then ? &quot;
&quot; Well , you know , after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position .
Nothing has been moved .
<unk> in charge here day and night .
This morning , as the man was buried and the investigation <unk> far as this room is <unk> thought we could <unk> up a bit .
This carpet .
You see , it is not fastened down ; only just laid there .
We had occasion to raise it .
We found &quot; &quot; Yes ?
You found &quot; Holmes &apos;s face grew <unk> with anxiety .
&quot; Well , I &apos;m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find .
You see that stain on the carpet ?
Well , a great deal must have <unk> through , must it not ? &quot;
&quot; Undoubtedly it must . &quot;
&quot; Well , you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond . &quot;
&quot; No stain !
But there must &quot; &quot; Yes ; so you would say .
But the fact remains that there isn &apos;t . &quot;
He took the corner of the carpet in his hand and , turning it over , he showed that it was indeed as he said .
&quot; But the underside is as stained as the upper .
It must have left a mark . &quot;
Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert .
&quot; Now I &apos;ll show you the explanation .
There is a second stain , but it does not correspond with the other .
See for yourself . &quot;
As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet , and there , sure enough , was a great crimson <unk> upon the square white facing of the oldfashioned floor .
&quot; What do you make of that , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; Why , it is simple enough .
The two stains did correspond , but the carpet has been turned round .
As it was square and <unk> it was easily done . &quot;
&quot; The official police don &apos;t need you , Mr. Holmes , to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round .
That &apos;s clear enough , for the stains lie above each <unk> you lay it over this way .
But what I want to know is , who shifted the carpet , and why ? &quot;
I could see from Holmes &apos;s rigid face that he was <unk> with inward excitement .
&quot; Look here , Lestrade , &quot; said he , &quot; has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , he has . &quot;
&quot; Well , take my advice .
<unk> him carefully .
Don &apos;t do it before us .
We &apos;ll wait here .
You take him into the back room .
You &apos;ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone .
Ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room .
Don &apos;t ask him if he has done it .
Take it for granted .
Tell him you know someone has been here .
Press him .
Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of <unk> .
Do exactly what I tell you ! &quot;
&quot; By George , if he knows I &apos;ll have it out of him ! &quot;
cried Lestrade .
He darted into the hall , and a few moments later his <unk> voice <unk> from the back room .
&quot; Now , Watson , now ! &quot;
cried Holmes , with <unk> eagerness .
All the <unk> force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy .
He tore the drugget from the floor , and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it .
One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it .
It hinged back like the lid of a box .
A small black <unk> opened beneath it .
Holmes plunged his eager hand into it , and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment .
It was empty .
&quot; Quick , Watson , quick !
Get it back again ! &quot;
The wooden lid was replaced , and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade &apos;s voice was heard in the passage .
He found Holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece , resigned and patient , endeavouring to conceal his <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> to keep you waiting , Mr. Holmes .
I can see that you are <unk> to death with the whole affair .
Well , he has confessed , all right .
Come in here , MacPherson .
Let these gentlemen hear of your most <unk> conduct . &quot;
The big constable , very hot and <unk> , <unk> into the room .
&quot; I meant no harm , sir , I &apos;m sure .
The young woman came to the door last <unk> the house , she did .
And then we got talking .
It &apos;s <unk> , when you &apos;re on duty here all day . &quot;
&quot; Well , what happened then ? &quot;
&quot; She wanted to see where the crime was <unk> read about it in the papers , she said .
She was a very respectable , <unk> young woman , sir , and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep .
When she saw that mark on the carpet , down she dropped on the floor , and lay as if she were dead .
I ran to the back and got some water , but I could not bring her to .
Then I went round the corner to the <unk> <unk> for some brandy , and by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was <unk> of herself , I dare say , and dared not face me . &quot;
&quot; How about moving that drugget ? &quot;
&quot; Well , sir , it was a bit rumpled , certainly , when I came back .
You see , she fell on it , and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place .
I straightened it out afterwards . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a lesson to you that you can &apos;t deceive me , <unk> MacPherson , &quot; said Lestrade , with dignity .
&quot; No doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered , and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room .
It &apos;s lucky for you , my man , that nothing is missing , or you would find yourself in <unk> Street .
I &apos;m sorry to have called you down over such a petty business , Mr. Holmes , but I thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you . &quot;
&quot; Certainly , it was most interesting .
Has this woman only been here once , constable ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , only once . &quot;
&quot; Who was she ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t know the name , sir .
Was answering an advertisement about typewriting , and came to the wrong <unk> pleasant , genteel young woman , sir . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ?
<unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir ; she was a <unk> young woman .
I suppose you might say she was handsome .
Perhaps some would say she was very handsome .
<unk> , officer , do let me have a peep ! &apos;
says she .
She had pretty , <unk> ways , as you might say , and I thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door . &quot;
&quot; How was she dressed ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , <unk> long mantle down to her feet . &quot;
&quot; What time was it ? &quot;
&quot; It was just <unk> <unk> at the time .
They were lighting the lamps as I came back with the brandy . &quot;
&quot; Very good , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; Come , Watson , I think that we have more important work elsewhere . &quot;
As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room , while the <unk> constable opened the door to let us out .
Holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand .
The constable stared intently .
&quot; Good Lord , sir ! &quot;
he cried , with amazement on his face .
Holmes put his finger on his lips , replaced his hand in his <unk> , and burst out laughing as we turned down the street .
&quot; Excellent ! &quot;
said he .
&quot; Come , friend Watson , the curtain rings up for the last act .
You will be relieved to hear that there will be no war , that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career , that the indiscreet <unk> will receive no <unk> for his indiscretion , that the Prime Minister will have no European <unk> to deal with , and that with a little <unk> and <unk> upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident . &quot;
My mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man .
&quot; You have solved it ! &quot;
I cried .
&quot; Hardly that , Watson .
There are some points which are as dark as ever .
But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest .
We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a head . &quot;
When we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired .
We were shown into the morningroom .
&quot; Mr.
Holmes ! &quot;
said the lady , and her face was <unk> with her indignation , &quot; this is surely most unfair and <unk> upon your part .
I desired , as I have explained , to keep my visit to you a secret , lest my husband should think that I was intruding into his affairs .
And yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us . &quot;
&quot; Unfortunately , madam , I had no possible alternative .
I have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper .
I must therefore ask you , madam , to be kind enough to place it in my hands . &quot;
The lady sprang to her feet , with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face .
Her eyes <unk> <unk> thought that she would faint .
Then with a <unk> effort she <unk> from the shock , and a supreme astonishment and indignation <unk> every other expression from her features .
&quot; <unk> insult me , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; Come , come , madam , it is useless .
Give up the letter . &quot;
She darted to the bell .
&quot; The butler shall show you out . &quot;
&quot; Do not ring , Lady Hilda .
If you do , then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be <unk> .
Give up the letter and all will be set right .
If you will work with me I can arrange everything .
If you work against me I must expose you . &quot;
She stood <unk> defiant , a queenly figure , her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul .
Her hand was on the bell , but she had <unk> to ring it .
&quot; You are trying to <unk> me .
It is not a very manly thing , Mr. Holmes , to come here and <unk> a woman .
You say that you know something .
What is it that you know ? &quot;
&quot; Pray sit down , madam .
You will hurt yourself there if you fall .
I will not speak until you sit down .
Thank you . &quot;
&quot; I give you five minutes , Mr.
Holmes . &quot;
&quot; One is enough , Lady Hilda .
I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas , of your giving him this document , of your ingenious return to the room last night , and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hidingplace under the carpet . &quot;
She stared at him with an <unk> face and <unk> twice before she could speak .
&quot; You are mad , Mr. <unk> are mad ! &quot;
she cried , at last .
He drew a small piece of <unk> from his pocket .
It was the face of a woman cut out of a <unk> .
&quot; I have carried this because I thought it might be useful , &quot; said he .
&quot; The policeman has recognised it . &quot;
She gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair .
&quot; Come , Lady Hilda .
You have the letter .
The matter may still be <unk> .
I have no desire to bring trouble to you .
My duty ends when I have returned the lost letter to your husband .
Take my advice and be frank with me ; it is your only chance . &quot;
Her courage was admirable .
Even now she would not own defeat .
&quot; I tell you again , Mr. Holmes , that you are under some absurd illusion . &quot;
Holmes rose from his chair .
&quot; I am sorry for you , Lady Hilda .
I have done my best for you ; I can see that it is all in vain . &quot;
He rang the bell .
The butler entered .
&quot; Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home ? &quot;
&quot; He will be home , sir , at a quarter to one . &quot;
Holmes glanced at his watch .
&quot; Still a quarter of an hour , &quot; said he .
&quot; Very good , I shall wait . &quot;
The butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda was down on her knees at Holmes &apos;s feet , her hands outstretched , her beautiful face upturned and wet with her <unk> .
&quot; Oh , spare me , Mr. Holmes !
<unk> me ! &quot;
she <unk> , in a frenzy of <unk> .
&quot; For Heaven &apos;s sake , don &apos;t tell him !
I love him so !
I would not bring one shadow on his life , and this I know would break his noble heart . &quot;
Holmes raised the lady .
&quot; I am <unk> , madam , that you have come to your senses even at this last moment !
There is not an instant to lose .
Where is the letter ? &quot;
She darted across to a writingdesk , unlocked it , and drew out a long blue envelope .
&quot; Here it is , Mr. Holmes .
Would to Heaven I had never seen it ! &quot;
&quot; How can we return it ? &quot;
Holmes <unk> .
&quot; Quick , quick , we must think of some way !
Where is the despatchbox ? &quot;
&quot; Still in his bedroom . &quot;
&quot; What a stroke of luck !
Quick , madam , bring it here ! &quot;
A moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand .
&quot; How did you open it before ?
You have a duplicate key ?
Yes , of course you have .
<unk> it ! &quot;
From out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key .
The box flew open .
It was stuffed with papers .
Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them , between the leaves of some other document .
The box was shut , locked , and returned to the bedroom .
&quot; Now we are ready for him , &quot; said Holmes ; &quot; we have still ten minutes .
I am going far to screen you , Lady Hilda .
In return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Holmes , I will tell you everything , &quot; cried the lady .
&quot; Oh , Mr. Holmes , I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of sorrow !
There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I do , and yet if he knew how I have <unk> I have been compelled to <unk> would never forgive me .
For his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or <unk> a <unk> in another .
Help me , Mr. Holmes !
My happiness , his happiness , our very lives are at stake ! &quot;
&quot; Quick , madam , the time grows short ! &quot;
&quot; It was a letter of mine , Mr. Holmes , an indiscreet letter written before my <unk> foolish letter , a letter of an impulsive , <unk> girl .
I meant no harm , and yet he would have thought it criminal .
Had he read that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed .
It is years since I wrote it .
I had thought that the whole matter was forgotten .
Then at last I heard from this man , Lucas , that it had passed into his hands , and that he would lay it before my husband .
I implored his mercy .
He said that he would return my letter if I would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband &apos;s despatchbox .
He had some <unk> in the office who had told him of its existence .
He assured me that no harm could come to my husband .
Put yourself in my position , Mr. Holmes !
What was I to do ? &quot;
&quot; Take your husband into your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I could not , Mr. Holmes , I could not !
On the one side seemed certain ruin ; on the other , terrible as it seemed to take my husband &apos;s paper , still in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences , while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me .
I did it , Mr. Holmes !
I took an impression of his key ; this man Lucas furnished a duplicate .
I opened his despatchbox , took the paper , and conveyed it to Godolphin Street . &quot;
&quot; What happened there , madam ? &quot;
&quot; I tapped at the door as agreed .
Lucas opened it .
I followed him into his room , leaving the hall door ajar behind me , for I feared to be alone with the man .
I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered .
Our business was soon done .
He had my letter on his desk ; I handed him the document .
He gave me the letter .
At this instant there was a sound at the door .
There were steps in the passage .
Lucas quickly turned back the drugget , thrust the document into some hidingplace there , and covered it over .
&quot; What happened after that is like some fearful dream .
I have a vision of a dark , frantic face , of a woman &apos;s voice , which screamed in French , &apos; My waiting is not in vain .
At last , at last I have found you with her ! &apos;
There was a savage struggle .
I saw him with a chair in his hand , a knife gleamed in hers .
I rushed from the horrible scene , ran from the house , and only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result .
That night I was happy , for I had my letter , and I had not seen yet what the future would bring .
&quot; It was the next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one trouble for another .
My husband &apos;s <unk> at the loss of his paper went to my heart .
I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what I had done .
But that again would mean a confession of the past .
I came to you that morning in order to understand the full <unk> of my <unk> .
From the instant that I grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband &apos;s paper .
It must still be where Lucas had placed it , for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room .
If it had not been for her coming , I should not have known where his hidingplace was .
How was I to get into the room ?
For two days I watched the place , but the door was never left open .
Last night I made a last attempt .
What I did and how I succeeded , you have already learned .
I brought the paper back with me , and thought of destroying it since I could see no way of returning it , without confessing my guilt to my husband .
Heavens , I hear his step upon the stair ! &quot;
The European Secretary burst <unk> into the room .
&quot; Any news , Mr. Holmes , any news ? &quot;
he cried .
&quot; I have some hopes . &quot;
&quot; Ah , thank <unk> ! &quot;
His face became <unk> .
&quot; The Prime Minister is <unk> with me .
May he share your hopes ?
He has nerves of steel , and yet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event .
Jacobs , will you ask the Prime Minister to come up ?
As to you , dear , I fear that this is a matter of politics .
We will join you in a few minutes in the diningroom . &quot;
The Prime Minister &apos;s manner was <unk> , but I could see by the gleam of his eyes and the <unk> of his <unk> hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague .
&quot; I understand that you have something to report , Mr.
Holmes ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> negative as yet , &quot; my friend answered .
&quot; I have inquired at every point where it might be , and I am sure that there is no danger to be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; But that is not enough , Mr. Holmes .
We cannot live for ever on such a <unk> .
We must have something definite . &quot;
&quot; I am in hopes of getting it .
That is why I am here .
The more I think of the matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this house . &quot;
&quot; Mr.
Holmes ! &quot;
&quot; If it had it would certainly have been public by now . &quot;
&quot; But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house ? &quot;
&quot; I am not convinced that anyone did take it . &quot;
&quot; Then how could it leave the despatchbox ? &quot;
&quot; I am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatchbox . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Holmes , this joking is very <unk> .
You have my assurance that it left the box . &quot;
&quot; Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning ? &quot;
&quot; No ; it was not necessary . &quot;
&quot; You may conceivably have overlooked it . &quot;
&quot; Impossible , I say . &quot;
&quot; But I am not convinced of it ; I have known such things to happen .
I presume there are other papers there .
Well , it may have got <unk> with them . &quot;
&quot; It was on the top . &quot;
&quot; Someone may have shaken the box and <unk> it . &quot;
&quot; No , no ; I had everything out . &quot;
&quot; Surely it is easily decided , Hope , &quot; said the Premier .
&quot; Let us have the despatchbox brought in . &quot;
The Secretary rang the bell .
&quot; Jacobs , bring down my despatchbox .
This is a farcical waste of time , but still , if nothing else will satisfy you , it shall be done .
Thank you , Jacobs ; put it here .
I have always had the key on my watchchain .
Here are the papers , you see .
<unk> from Lord <unk> , report from Sir Charles Hardy , <unk> from <unk> , note on the <unk> <unk> taxes , letter from <unk> , note from Lord <unk> heavens !
what is this ?
Lord Bellinger !
Lord Bellinger ! &quot;
The Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand .
&quot; Yes , it is <unk> the letter is <unk> .
Hope , I congratulate you . &quot;
&quot; Thank you !
Thank you !
What a weight from my heart .
But this is <unk> .
Mr. Holmes , you are a wizard , a <unk> !
How did you know it was there ? &quot;
&quot; Because I knew it was nowhere else . &quot;
&quot; I cannot believe my eyes ! &quot;
He ran wildly to the door .
&quot; Where is my wife ?
I must tell her that all is well .
Hilda !
Hilda ! &quot;
we heard his voice on the stairs .
The Premier looked at Holmes with <unk> eyes .
&quot; Come , sir , &quot; said he .
&quot; There is more in this than meets the eye .
How came the letter back in the box ? &quot;
Holmes turned away smiling from the keen <unk> of those <unk> eyes .
&quot; We also have our <unk> secrets , &quot; said he , and picking up his hat he turned to the door .
